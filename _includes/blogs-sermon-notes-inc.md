# Sermon Notes

i write sermon notes, but i also often lose physical books (and also barely write much anyway), so starting from 6 June 2022, i've decided to put them up here! Feel free to read through what i was able to catch from HCC's weekly Sunday morning celebration service, or Youth Services on Saturday, or even the annual Church Camp & Youth Camp!
