# My Experiences in Internship Training Programme
For **almost all polytechnic students**, we all have to take internship for a variable amount of time in our **last semester**. This blog will be for me to track down what I did everyday and how it is everyday. Hopefully, somehow I will be able to make this for official use for all I did.

<span style="font-size:130%;">I intend to have this as **something I can pass down** to whoever is the **intern after me**, or at most, anyone in **_NYP: School of IT_**</span>, though all details are dependant on the internship organization.

Here are some details about my internship that I can share (publicly):
* Time period (**applicable for Year 2022**):
    * **7 March 2022** to **27 May 2022**
    * This may **vary between every student**. There can be different lengths and different timings, such as a **3-month** internship <span style="font-size:80%;">(like what I chose)</span>, **6-month** internship and a **12-month** long internship <span style="font-size:80%;">(or apprenticeship for that last one)</span>.
    * This means that the first intern who reads this will start internship in **30 May** (and will continue to have internship until **19 August** <span style="font-size:70%;">kinda</span>)
        * This intern (most likely the person reading this) will leave behind their own things to pass-over to the next intern, who will have ITP from **5 Sep** to **25 Nov**, and the next person after that person will have ITP from **28 Nov** to **17 Feb**, and so on till death reaches us all.
* The company, I think, I may keep it confidential for now and also most of the customers of this company too. I will describe it throughout the weeks though, as to create my narrative of how I lived this ITP.
* (To the next intern) What I have been passed on over to me
    * This is something you can find in **Dropbox -> Things to take note for intern -> Arif March 2022 Intern** <span style="font-size:70%;">(iirc)</span>
* (To the next intern) What I can pass on to you
    * The same as above.
* (To the next intern) What I have done
    * This blog :D and also a list of important things to note when you end your internship.

I have organised each day chronlogically, feel free to look through however you want. All the best, intern!
