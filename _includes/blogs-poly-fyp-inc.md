# my polytechnic final-year project odyssey
for **almost all polytechnic students**, we all have to commit to a final-year project (aka FYPJ, or FYP) for a variable amount of time in our **last semester**. This blog will be for me to track down what I did everyday and how it is everyday. 

Here are some details about my fyp that I can share (publicly):
* Time period (**applicable for Year 2022**):
    * I had my fyp from **30 May 2022** to **19 Aug 2022**
    * The rest of the details I was gonna copy over from the [internship page](/internship) but I figured that most of the information there aren't relevant
    * I also found that a lot of things that are in FYP are confidential

Note that for **every single person**, FYP would be different for everyone, and everyone would have different experiences.

I have organised each day chronlogically, feel free to look through however you want.
