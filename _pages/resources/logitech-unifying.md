# Logitech Unifying Devices Gallery

So, the only place where I could find a list of Logitech devices, that are compatible with the Unifying Dongle that Logitech created, is in <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-devices-can-I-pair-with-my-Logitech-unifying-receiver-other-than-a-mouse-and-keyboard" target="_blank">this Quora page</a>, last updated 2014 (yikes).

The Unifying Technology that Logitech created is actually amazing. The average number of USB type A ports in any typical laptop is usually 2. Both of my X250 and my C640 have 2 USB type A ports. What if you need to connect to 2 devices using both ports, then basically you will have both ports used up like that! 

The Unifying Technology allows multiple devices that are compatible with Unifying to _connect to the same Unifying Dongle_, and even the dongle that came with those devices doesn't even need to be used! Up to 6 devices can be connected at a time, which, in my perspective, is already more than what an average consumer uses. 

Unfortunately, Logitech nowadays is trying to market other products that are not Unifying, and I don't know of a solid reason why so. If you kinda know why, please leave a comment below!
