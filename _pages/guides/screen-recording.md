# Optimized Screen Recording <span style="font-size:70%">on Android</span>

_&lt;note for arif: state how android 11 or so already gives screen recording but it kinda sucks because it uses the same gpu or whatever&gt;_

A lot of commands here actually relates to the [Android Debug Bridge](https://arifhamed.com/guides/adb), and a few pieces of software that I will explicitly state that is needed.

### Here are some programs that you need to start recording your Android phone's audio and screen:

* <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/tag/v1.23" target="_blank">scrcpy</a> by <a href="http://genymobile.com/" target="_blank">Genymotion</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy/releases/tag/v1.1" target="_blank">sndcpy</a> by <a href="https://github.com/rom1v" target="_blank">rom1v</a>
* Your Android phone
* A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer
* Xbox Game Bar (usually comes with Windows 10 nowadays)

_&lt;more details will come soon&gt;_
