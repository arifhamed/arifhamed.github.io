# 57th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[00:00]</span> <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Today is Pan Visibility Day, and almost no one within my circles are aware of what pansexuality is. After months of reflection, I finally identified myself as a pansexual person, and I want to let people know it, when the time comes.'">Today's a great day, and its not because my internship is ending, it is a totally different reason that I will not tell anyone <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup></span>

<span class="timestamp">[15:53]</span> <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> Finally, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> provided his available time slot for the final countdo- i mean, final presentation. I can't help but feel a bit of relief, as soon, this will all be over soon. I gotta do the reflection thingy and send it to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML=''">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> by tomorrow though, best to make my time fruitful and do it today, then perhaps tomorrow I can

<span class="timestamp">[16:48]</span> <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> damn, the readability of my home keyboard is dying. gotta get a new one soon, one without RBG Yeah that's right, I said the thing that every gamer is forbidden to say. You cannot exile me because I have exiled myself already!! Man, this keyboard is still good though, gotta find a good buyer if i'm actually gonna get a new keyboard.

huh, i'm already getting off topic from this internsh- this is a live blog, not an internship blog!

Hmmmm, i may as well create one. I just remembered to add in tags too! I really gotta implement search to this ASAP.
