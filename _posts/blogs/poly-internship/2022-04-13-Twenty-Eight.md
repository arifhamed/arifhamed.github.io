<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">I feel like i've become a bit numb after the mental hailstorm that i partook in the last 2 days, not including today. Maybe it's because Good Friday is getting closer. It's so close i can taste it.<br><br> I've figured that ghosting more than a week would absolutely not fix anything. The only concern I have now is the fact that I have to be in Woodlands North for cell group. oh lord help me. i have no idea how other cell leaders handle this. maybe i should really just get a driver's licence. oh gosh it's gonna be like this until covid decreases so that we can gather back to 10 ppl :'(</span>
