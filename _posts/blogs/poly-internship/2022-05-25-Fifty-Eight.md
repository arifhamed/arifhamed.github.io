# 58th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[12:15]</span> Aight, to be clear, I did not ask for it. By right, today was supposed to be my last day of WFH, but then <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ms Olivia'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> saw that I had a presentation tomorrow (this will be mentioned more in the next paragraph, btw), so they extended my WFH from today to tomorrow! It even showed on the Google Calendar.

I feel there would be conflict, unless <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ms Olivia'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> (HR) & <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> (IS) has clearly contact between them, because my SIM, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, is not available tomorrow, but is available on Friday. omg this a mental catastrophe. Well, now I got to modify my presentation, because <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> gave me some new guidelines. beh

<span class="timestamp">[23:51]</span> Either my resolve to keep on journalling is diminishing or i was using much more time in creating the script and sharpening the powerpoint. Yeah its probably the latter. So in the end, i'll be presenting on my final Friday, <span class="timestamp">09:15</span>, and somehow, still got WFH tomorrow. I should be a tad bit glad that I did not include this website in any of the feedback or report that I have submitted to NYP or to the HR, cuz damn, i stand by freedom of speech. Also, somehow, a lot and nothing happened today <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>.
