# Final day of internship :D

<span class="timestamp">[11:51]</span> i just had a short presentation with <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> & <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, and, well, I wouldn't say it was formal, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> asked questions after each slide. However, I think it is alright, and if anything, they became interested in the Python RPA that I was creating secretly, more than what I had to present.

After that, I was serene. All I had for my internship was done...

...now, it was FYP that I had to be concerned about now. 

I saw the video briefing and the documents, the details, the platforms, all given through email, and I kinda internally died?..

...but at the same time, I did saw the name of my project, which was named "<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='New Canteen Model for local Primary School'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>", and, well, in some sense, its kinda comforting, but i really want to relax this remaining time in work and the weekends.

<span class="timestamp">[12:44]</span> I know for a fact that i'll continue to blog & document my adventures in FYP, which, well, i foresee may not be much, but whatever, i'll see how it is <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. You can find me in NYP, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='L.329 EZS13'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, from 30 May to 19 August.

<span class="timestamp">[16:28]</span> I shown my Python RPA to the SIM, and am I going to give documentation? probably not, haha, sorry intern <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. I'm actually, like, almost running out of ideas to say. I actually do have a lot to say, but I also would very much want to. 

<span class="timestamp">[16:54]</span> it's almost 5pm, and, y'know, i'm not supposed to blogging like this, but this blog was done through <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Visual Studio Code'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, so no one knew any better, everyone just thought it was some personal project that I did if I had an idle day. all my e-Logs were just the daily tasks, and the reflection, i..

i, ah <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='fuck'">***</span> it

i'm done. last commit to /blogs/poly-internship
