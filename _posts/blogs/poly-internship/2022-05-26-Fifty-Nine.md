# 59th day of internship, final WFH

<span class="timestamp">[11:37]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[15:40]</span> You know, there is this serene calm before the storm today, before tomorrow. Last day

<span class="timestamp">[19:47]</span> before getting dinner, i kept that X220 that I was given just in case COVID strikes hard again (it did not), and you know, I think i'll miss it. It's a nice small quaint laptop, it had a whole lot of side peripherals and all. I liked it, the only thing I don't like about is the fact that it is so slow. I think it had 4GB ram, but looking at the state of the laptop, it's also very old. It's not painfully slow though, just slower than normal.

Now, I gotta prepare the following things to bring back to office tomorrow for handover:
* Cisco IP Phone (SPA525G)
    * Receiver
    * LAN cable
    * Switching Power Supply (MODEL: PSAWC05R-050; 5V)
* Lenovo ThinkPad X220
    * Lenovo ThinkPad AC Adapter (round tip) 65W 20V
    * Lenovo ThinkPad AC Adapter (round tip) 90W 20V
    * Rechargeable Li-ion Battery X220 (11.1V 5200mAh)
    * Lenovo ThinkPad Executive Laptop Carrying Case Bag

There is so many ideas, but my mind already left internship. It left for vacation when I got a notice that I can go WFH. 

Oh yeah, btw, my successor intern, I have autism, so if my experience may seem much more chill than yours, just know that I have a disability, so, um, yeah pls don't, like, hate me, haha..
