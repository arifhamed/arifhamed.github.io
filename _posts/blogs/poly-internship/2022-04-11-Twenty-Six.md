<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> my mind is in a mess. everything is everywhere. stop it, stop it. shut up. i cannot feel. i don't feel human. i can't think.<br><br>my mind has gone asunder, everywhere like hurricane tearing apart a small town. i cannot even express this in words, nor imagery. no motivation to keep on going. nothing else matters anymore. i feel so selfish. horrible, it's all horrible.<br><br>a static heart, lost soul, hopeless, without a light or a guide. <br><br>perhaps, it's just the silence?<br><br>i don't feel like breathing. the air hates me. the wind never sweeps my way. my laughter of insanity is only to remind of my insignificance of the world, and the significance of nothingness. i am my greatest conspiracy against myself, and no one & everyone believes in it.<br><br>is everything alright? is everything truly alright? i cannot seem to see it happen. i cannot see my life correctly. even if it is different, my future is like a fog into a waterfall of nothingness. no matter how philantrophical  i can be about hope, despair can still reign.<br><br>i'm not saying i have hope now, but i know this despair of life will not persist. i have to persist not jumping in front of a bus or off the roof of this tower. God, if you're there, help me.<br><br>this, i think. i think i just had a panic attack, not just a mere existential crisis. a whole mix of emotions and swings, about others & myself. i need time to cool off. <br><br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> Guess the lunch and long nap was what i needed. I still need some time to think about myself again, but the mind's clearer to type out stuff, but still. Recently i just became super-aware of myself, especially of how life is much more of a struggle living with autism. It truly kinda sucks, like, yeah no one grows out of it, and for those who are fortunate enough to receive treatment to handle the symptoms like me, not much is changed on the inside. All my life it's just me making myself fit for the sake of everyone else. <br><br>its, <i style="font-size:80%;">sigh</i>, it can be hard. its so hard to live like this. Its not only hard to keep this up, but it is also hard because when I don't want to hide myself, I feel like i'm inconveniencing everyone else to be accommodating. There are so many times where I asked God, "_why_"? Why is this something happens in life sometimes, and how does this curse contribute to Your Will, God?<br><br>i'll definitely write more tomorrow </span>
