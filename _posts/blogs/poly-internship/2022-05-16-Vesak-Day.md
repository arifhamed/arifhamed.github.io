# Vesak Day

<span class="timestamp">[14:44]</span> aw shucks, this day really gotta do the report and poster. i delayed way too much on saturday, gotta do it now. Whether or not i did i'll update back here, God forbid the latter.

<span class="timestamp">[19:04]</span> Alright, besides a few photos and the typography, i'm kinda done with the report, and the poster can wait a bit. However, it was only today I just found out that there was a presentation that i have to do.

jesus christ, like, what the heck. Look, I read the rubrics, but..

<span class="timestamp">[22:05]</span> ..there was no mention of it anywhere in it! Also, yes, wow, got distraction like nothing <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.

<span class="timestamp">[22:53]</span> <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>

It has probably been a while since we last contacted but all of the sudden when I talked to him about the presentation, he referred to me as "<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Muhammad'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>". Don't frackin' call me that. Never call me by a name that almost every person of my race has. Is it that hard to call me by whatever the second word is? <BR><BR>ARIF<BR><BR>IS IT THAT FUCKING HARD TO CALL ME THAT? And i know for a fact that he IS SINGAPOREAN because HE WORKED FOR NYP FOR 27 FUCKING YEARS<br><br>gosh. <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='call every malay boy muhammad then, huh? fuckface mcgee'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span><br><br>i'm so goddamn angry. there is a line between an honest mistake and being an ignorant bastard.<br><br>_sigh_<br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> aight it was probably and an honest mistake</span>
