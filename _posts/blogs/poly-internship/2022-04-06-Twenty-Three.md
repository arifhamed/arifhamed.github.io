# 23rd day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[14:35]</span> I have almost slept a cumulative hour today in office, and I do not know why. Perhaps my body is starting to subconsciously want to have 7 hours of sleep instead of the usual 4/5.5 hours. As long as my mind is still awake now, I may as well grasp the opportunity to write down that new task i did.

<span class="timestamp">[15:23]</span> Damn, i really procrastinated for an hour. It about now that i actually typed the first task below.

<span class="timestamp">[17:56]</span> Before leaving, I have found that I am back into the APK-collector gig.

### What i did new today
* Ping CCTV DVR from any server for <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Top Plasterceil Pte Ltd'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: client name&gt;</span>.
    * Log in to server computer with TeamViewer, details has been saved to the IT Support TeamViewer account (which means I didn't need to ask or manually find it in the IT info)
    * Refering to IT info anyway, log in using any available account that is logged into the PC already.
    * Open `cmd` or `powershell`
    * Type in `ping <WLAN-IP>` and replace `<WLAN-IP>` with what the IT info says about the DVR (should just contain one)
        * Learnt that the port does not work with ping, ie 192.168.50.154:5555 won't work
