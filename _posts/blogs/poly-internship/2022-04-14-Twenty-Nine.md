...aaaaand here's the reflection.

---
---

As I begin to reflect, i realise that a lot of the psychological & mental aspect of my life are not influenced by this work that NYP and <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Infospace'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> has entrusted me with, but instead, it revolves something in my personal life, something that is irrelevant to work.

To be frank, this week my mind has undergone a huge torrent of torture, whether it comes from myself or _external forces_. Even as of now, I find it hard to reflect as I am still in mental burden over something, even before Good Friday. Whether be it from the silent suffering of my autism, or the overwhelming sadness that is almost losing a friendship, or even the painfully stretching concept of growing up in this modern age. I can't believe i'm starting to think of all of this now, even though by a technical sense I do still have time, I still worry over the unforeseeable future.

In the end, I am still ever so grateful that it just happens that this week holds a public holiday (and thank goodness for the next 2 in my internship too). Perhaps I can finally rest my mind over the long weekend. The others in the company don't see it, but my mind really goes through a lot in a day, even when I don't initiate it. Perhaps this is somewhat related to my condition, hiding my true self away for the benefit of others. More or less, I am glad to have chosen the shortest option for internship. The work that I receive on a daily basis is good for me, and (in the spirit of Easter) I am grateful for it.

As my first half of internship ends, I have come to realise that perhaps this isn't so.. well, I don't want to cause anything to happen against my word. There is still the entire other half of my internship to go through, and my God better be there with me too.

Thank you for reading, and God bless.
