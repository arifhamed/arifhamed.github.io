# Good Friday

hi. today is an awesome day, and so is this easter sunday too.

btw, yes, i'm including the numbers for weekdays without work, just for the sake of easily keeping track of the days when creating this blog. this means that today is the 30th day of internship, but it technically isn't.

You, intern, can also check in the google calendar where you have public holidays or not. Including today, I have 4 ðŸ˜Ž. If you are from June to August, you have 3. Our successor intern from September to November, well, has 1. The next intern from December to February also just has Christmas, and maybe chinese new year if your IS allows you for visitation, or depends on your company. 

If you're malay and had whatever period has puasa or haji, then you're good (like me), and likewise for the other race-centric PHs, excluding christmas and good friday, everyone benefits from those.

Embrace each day that you're blessed with an approved off-day or public holiday!
