# Sixth day of internship: Here we go again

<span class="timestamp">[06:47]</span> Yo intern, one thing i missed out to do yesterday is to do my ART test, so **remember to do it EVERY SUNDAY AND SEND IT** TO <span style="font-size:70%;">iirc</span> the administrator or HR. So, uh, I'm doing it now (if it is just the Suntec office that I must visit, I would usually wake at _0600_)

I am grateful that the company was able to provide art tests for the entire internship. I am only required to do once per week, so they gave me 10 free ART kits, so in the 12 weeks, i just need 2 from myself <span style="font-size:80%;">(though maybe they would give 2 more just as a compensation, idk, it's the start of Week 2)</span>. Be grateful for your weekend too, like most companies, the one here is pretty chill, strictly work from 9am-6pm, no more, no less. Oh and lunch is flexible, just one hour, in between 12pm to 2pm.

<span class="timestamp">[17:37]</span> Now this is an optimal time to do this blog, it's also good to do your e-Logs too. Let me tell you this, I have been vaccinated last year with the Moderna vaccine last year, and just got the booster (Pfizer) **yesterday**, and _**thank goodness**_ i'm fine until now, besides the aching in the muscles on my left arm. Right about now though, i'm starting to get a small headache.

<span class="timestamp">[21:16]</span> Gosh, the booster jab was really nothing <span style="font-size:50%;">saying this kinda hoping that I will jinx myself</span> and not much happened today, besides doing the following

### Some things I learnt/did today
* Power off, disconnect and safely put away one of those servers that looks like a huge PC, which was actually a Dell T620 Server. It was a bit hard to move since my left arm was still hurting from the booster. 
* <div class="container"><img src="/static/images/Dell_PowerEdge_T620_BIG.jpg" alt="image didn't load correctly"><div class="caption-middle">it was huge</div></div>
* Focused on making python work with Comments on Excel.
    * This was the reason why I decided to remake the RPA with Python. I am very experienced with Python automation, in which I straight up have an [entire page about it](https://arifhamed.github.io/guides/automation). Perhaps the next language in which I can use to automate stuff is C++. <span style="font-size:50%;">c++ pointers look like death though</span>

<span class="disable-selection" onclick="loadText()" style="color:#0001;">nothing deep happened today</span>
<span class="disable-selection" id="load-text" style="display:none;">I am even more so grateful with Christ and the community.<br><br>On Saturday we as the youth gathered for `oikos`, which is a time of gathering between the community simply to spend time together, get closer to one another (and of course, within the safe-distancing measures for churches).<br><br>On Sunday, ohoho let me tell you, the Word related way to much. From LTS, to the main praise & worship, and even the sermon, all talked about wilderness [Exodus 13: 17-22]. This internship is so different, but it is only my own mind that makes things worse, so I would rather let God have the final say. Plus, who knows, perhaps the wilderness that I'm in is better than the flat plains where enemies can come and invade easily.<br><br>God is doing something deep in this season, and I know it. I also now understand that everything that I have/am/will faced/facing/face in this internship is all according to His purpose. Hope keeps on going. </span>
