# 58th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[12:15]</span> Aight, to be clear, I did not ask for it. By right, today was suppoed to be my last day of WFH, but then <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ms Olivia'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> saw that I had a presentation tomorrow (this will be mentioned more in the next paragraph, btw), so they extended my WFH from today to tomorrow! It even showed on the Google Calendar.

I feel there would be conflict, unless <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ms Olivia'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> (HR) & <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> (IS) has clearly contact between them, because my SIM, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, is not available tomorrow, but is available on Friday. omg this a mental catastrophe. Well, now I got to modify my presentation, because <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Sunny'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> gave me some new guidelines. beh

<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML=''">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

{% include comments.html url=page.url %}

<input id="password-input" type="password" class="text-secret" onkeyup="unlock()">

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup><span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='there are some people who i just fucking hate right now. such fake smiles. huh. idiots, they are. i can see right through them. i'm not convinced.'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. I wanted so a lot but also contained a lot of vulgarities, so uh, yeah just ignore that redacted text.</span>
