Task name: Monthly ACME Monaco Offsite Backup Check

Task hours: 2

To create a Monthly ACME Monaco Offsite Backup Check, the following is the sequence that I have done:

1. Make a new email.
    * From: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ia@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company intern email&gt;</span>
    * To: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='alan@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company supervisor email&gt;</span>
        * The 'To' field is set to the supervisor because you need to get their approval first, after that you can switch it out with <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='shirley.lee@acmemonaco.com'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: a customer email&gt;</span>
    * Subject: "Data Offsite Backup check as of [DD MMM YYYY]"
1. Obtain screenshots of both local & offsite backup via NAS
    1. Open file explorer, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='C:\\Users\\User\\Dropbox\\InfoSpace Common\\Customers\\ACME Monaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file location&gt;</span>, and then open the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco IT info.xlsx'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file name&gt;</span>
    1. Go to the “Server and Network Info.” tab, and under the “NAS'' section, you will see the login information for the NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, as well as NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAOFFSITE'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>
    1. For now, click on the synology quickconnect link for <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, which is <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer quickconnect url&gt;</span>, then login with the credentials that are written in the guide.
    1. Once logged in, navigate to the "Main Menu", the icon in the top left, and then click on "Hyper Backup", as shown in the guide.
    1. Once in, screenshot the first one. 
1. After you have pasted the screenshot in the email, you will need to do the steps for the following image.
    1. Using the information found in step 3c, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonacooffsite'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: other customer NAS&gt;</span>, and as of writing this, the credentials are the same as the one above.
    1. After getting in, head to "File Station" which is located on the desktop, and then right click on the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS_1.hbk'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS file&gt;</span>, and click "Open Backup Explorer".
    1. As stated in the guide, you should include the timeline at the bottom of the window when taking the screenshot
    1. Paste it to the email, send to supervisor for approval before sending it to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Shirley'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

aight, the reflection is here, like the wifi.

---
---

This week's reflection shall be brief, as due to the presence of Labour Day & Hari Raya Puasa taking place in this week. As each day progresses in May, I also take note of when 27th of May also approaches. I have yet to make much progress on my report and whatever the poster is, my inspiration is not at its peak as it was at the start of this internship. However, if anything I will commit to my obligations.

The break was well needed, as I took the time to unmask myself at home and let go of many things that holds me back as a person, living comfortably in my communities. 

Not much related to my internship occured this week, besides my realization that I have done my <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monthly report'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> without prompt. As the 3rd quarter of my internship is done, I shall continue to write my emotions and feelings everyday, so that it will not interfere with my work here in this company.

It has occured to me that perhaps my reflection skills are also not optimal as of late. At the very least my predecessor intern has told me that this part of internship is not super optimal, and perhaps this reflection is also skimmed through fast. If the latter is false however, please take a look at my reflection that I have written last week. As I have said, everyone deserves to experience everything!

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">What an interesting day today. A Friday with no prayer meeting. This is likely due to sync with the Day of Conquest on Monday (2 May), or it could very much be related to the rest of the Church doing MIP doing.<br><br>i mean, yeah. Look, i want to write down these thoughts. I do not expect you to respond. All i ask is to have a listening ear.</span>
