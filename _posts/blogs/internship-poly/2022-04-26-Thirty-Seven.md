# 37th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[18:19]</span> Now this is a unique timestamp, huh? That's because I was tasked to make a delivery to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Export Trading Group'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. I left around <span class="timestamp">16:00</span>, arrived there by <span class="timestamp">16:20</span>, finished taking note of the serial numbers at <span class="timestamp">16:40</span>, then i just, well, chilled around <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Tanjong Pagar'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> until <span class="timestamp">17:00</span>, feelin' like soulja boy with a camel in dubai. After that, i just went home. Such a bright 2 days so far, like for real.

Also just occured to me that this blog, like, really is like an online diary. Do you think that diary is short for diarrhea, because you basically just shit all over your diary about your day.

### What i did today
* Receive a delivery from <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ingram Micro'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. Consists of
    * 5 Dell laptops
    * 5 Dell briefcases
    * 3 Dell docks
    * 1 Dell keyboard & mouse set
* Sent delivery to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Export Trading Group'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
    * 1 Dell laptop
    * 3 Dell docks
    * 1 Dell keyboard & mouse set
