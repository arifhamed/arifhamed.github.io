# NS Appointment

<span class="timestamp">[10:59]</span> Now today is a day indeed. Later i have to go to CMPB for some checkup or something, since it would be exactly 1 year from now that I would be enlisting, unless they determine my condition enough to exempt me.

<span class="timestamp">[13:22]</span> anyway... gotta go for cmpb.

<span class="timestamp">[17:26]</span> Damn, things got interesting for me in CMPB <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> I'm gonna summarise what happened in my appointment today. After discussing with the medical officer about my autism, they decided to refer me to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). Damn, that took a turn that I was not expecting at all! Apparently they have SAF therapists working in IMH, apparently for people like me. In the end, they have to determine my PES before deciding anything, and CMPB cannot reach a decision with me yet because of this. <br><br>Well, if anything, I am glad to have brought to light that I have autism to the medical officers in CMPB, else I would've gone through absolute hell for nothing. However, in everything, I am still unsure of the future, so i'll just give this situation to God in the end. <br><br>the mind's blurring again right now so, adios. thank God for such a supportive community, and also for that surprisingly supportive medical officer hahaha.</span>
