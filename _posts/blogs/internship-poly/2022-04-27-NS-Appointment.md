# NS Appointment

<span class="timestamp">[10:59]</span> Now today is a day indeed. Later i have to go to CMPB for some checkup or something, since it would be exactly 1 year from now that I would be enlisting, unless they determine my condition enough to exempt me. I kinda don't want to go through NS, but at the same time, I also kinda want my own house and not seen as a second class citizen. However, i'm still debating in the inside about it. No matter, whatever way lays its own benefits. 

<span class="timestamp">[13:22]</span> anyway... gotta go for cmpb.
