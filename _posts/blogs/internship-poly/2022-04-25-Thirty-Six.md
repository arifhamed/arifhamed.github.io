# 36th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[11:14]</span> A day isn't great by itself, rather, it should be a longer time period that a person should be happy about or smtg idk lmao <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. Also, starting [tomorrow](https://arifhamed.com/blogs/internship-poly/2022/04/26), groups visits to houses can now be allowed from 5 to **10** people <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>.

<span class="timestamp">[17:54]</span> In retrospect, today was actually really fast. didn't do shit today, besides probably had 4 micronaps, and continued my APK scouting. also, yesterday was the day i actually bought [arifhamed.com](arifhamed.com) dns from Google. good price imo, ngl.

<span class="timestamp">[26-Apr-2022-21:09]</span> <sup id="#3">[3]</sup> Correction, gov just removed the limit entirely.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> God's love won me again, and oh how I missed it! Yesterday during altar call, I saw everyone wanting for more. Matthew 7:7. On hindsight, I think I should've went too, but even on the gallery I saw people being with other people, and caring for them. As I looked, I realized that perhaps maybe this world isn't full of cold-hearted people after all, let alone this community. This is a community where I can truly be myself. i can feel His love. <br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> OH YES LORD!! Don't get me wrong, <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Elliot'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>'s house and family are nice and all, but going home after hg is pain. The other houses are signifantly better to traverse home. Now, I get to see the entire cell group again AS ONE ðŸ¥³. </span>
