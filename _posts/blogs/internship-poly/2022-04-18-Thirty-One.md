# 31st day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[07:28]</span> <sup><a href='#1'>[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[17:??]</span> I'm writing this from tomorrow because i was probably focused on other personal stuff, but i also forgot to add on the [what i did today](#what-i-did-today)

### What i did today
* Sent a request for leave for 27 April due to NS appointment
* Check units for <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Daniel Teo & Associates Pte Ltd'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> from 2018 to 2022. I just downloaded the sheet and used the Excel formulas to just get the sum for each of the years. 

{% include comments.html url=page.url %}

<input id="password-input" type="password" class="text-secret" onkeyup="unlock()">

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id='1'>[1]</sup> whilst taking a shower earlier, my mind teetered between which route of life i am gonna take. during the long weekend, the community of the church has helped so much in reminding how valuable this community is. so now between the church and my flesh i have to choose. my soul still suffers but not as much as last week. now i have to ask myself this: where is God in the picture?</span>
