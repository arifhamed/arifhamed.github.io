# 50th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[13:36]</span> Today's morning was a bit hectic, but hey, at least I can put that into my daily tasks.

<span class="timestamp">[14:04]</span> Somewhere in the work PC there is a food guide by a past intern, it's worth a read. On that note, I just want to say literally all the food that I have been eating here are either from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5CsK4KhQWatFuRKYA" target="_blank">Encik Tan</a>, E.A.T. & <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/YB8jhuDSMH66Pvqk8" target="_blank">7-Eleven</a>.

<span class="timestamp">[14:11]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[15:43]</span> I might need to go to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ETG'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> soon, so I guess I gotta go write down my e-Logs & reflection first.

Task name: <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Eximdis'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> onsite

Task hours: 2.5

* Learn what a wire tracker is and how it works. This is my interpretation: 
    * Consists of two parts, the signaller and the receiver. Connect any network cable (either RJ11 or RJ45) and the signaller will send a signal through the cable when turned on. 
    * Test the receiver. If it makes a beep boop sound when the tip is near and turned on, than that means the connection for that wire is working. It is otherwise if the receiver just makes static when turned on.
    * Most of the time, you would use this in infrastructure like an office, to see if a LAN port is connected and functioning to the server room for example. The parts would work in tandem usually far apart.
    * Most of the time, there could be a lot of cables in a switch (like in thie office) and it may be necessary to test each cable for the signal. If the signal is still picked up in a bunch of wires, then that means that the connection works and depending on the task, there may be no need to test each cable from there.
* Install TP-Link Access Points.
* Reorganize server room.

Most unmentioned tasks in this onsite are done by <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jae Liew'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

<span class="timestamp">[16:32]</span> I have to go RIGHT NOW to the customer site to set up that projector. Fun fact: I am to not reveal the fact that the projector was from us üòè and i don't know why. Speaking of which, I will upload the actual e-Logs & reflection when I get home.

<span class="timestamp">[Sat]</span> SO I forgot to write down the reflection and submit the e-Logs. Guess i'll finish it now.

As each week and day advances, my belief for the value of time management increases, as each day I find myself procrastinating against writing the report and creating the poster. More or less, I understand the purpose of each of those, and I would have been much more stressed out if it wasn't for previous examples shared through the ITP portal and Blackboard.

This week deviates from the usual routine: On Tuesday I was sent to a customer site for the first-time for a few weeks, excluding <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Export Trading Group'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. During that time I learned to use a tool that I have never seen before, and <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan Kuik'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> & <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jae Liew'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> adviced me well on how to use it. That onsite visit I got to meet a new person too, though it was brief.

On Friday, I had to deliver a projector to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ETG'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, and install it, and test it to see if it works, and also guided the receptionist the know-hows for the projector. 

These visits thought me that perhaps I.T. truly is something that many people cannot have a grasp on. It still brings a shock to me that there are people who have no idea how some certain things work. Perhaps setting up WiFi & a network is a bit harder, but in all honesty, it was the same day where I found that projector in <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='the Infospace office'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> and also sent that projector to set it up. 

I actually considered changing my industry whilst in this internship, as I thought that perhaps I.T. was hard for me. However I will not make any solid decisions yet, nor will I discuss any further details of my thoughts about this.

I cannot help but look forward to going back to school again, and seeing my schoolmates again. This internship really thought me the futility of capitalism.

Anyway, thanks for reading!
