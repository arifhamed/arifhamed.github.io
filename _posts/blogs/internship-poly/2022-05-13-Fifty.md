# 50th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[13:36]</span> Today's morning was a bit hectic, but hey, at least I can put that into my daily tasks.

<span class="timestamp">[14:04]</span> Somewhere in the work PC there is a food guide by a past intern, it's worth a read. On that note, I just want to say literally all the food that I have been eating here are either from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5CsK4KhQWatFuRKYA" target="_blank">Encik Tan</a>, E.A.T. & <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/YB8jhuDSMH66Pvqk8" target="_blank">7-Eleven</a>.

<span class="timestamp">[14:11]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[15:43]</span> I might need to go to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ETG'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> soon, so I guess I gotta go write down my e-Logs & reflection first.

Task name: <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Eximdis'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> onsite

Task hours: 2.5

* Learn what a wire tracker is and how it works. This is my interpretation: 
    * Consists of two parts, the signaller and the receiver. Connect any network cable (either RJ11 or RJ45) and the signaller will send a signal through the cable when turned on. 
    * Test the receiver. If it makes a beep boop sound when the tip is near and turned on, than that means the connection for that wire is working. It is otherwise if the receiver just makes static when turned on.
    * Most of the time, you would use this in infrastructure like an office, to see if a LAN port is connected and functioning to the server room for example. The parts would work in tandem usually far apart.
    * Most of the time, there could be a lot of cables in a switch (like in thie office) and it may be necessary to test each cable for the signal. If the signal is still picked up in a bunch of wires, then that means that the connection works and depending on the task, there may be no need to test each cable from there.
* Install TP-Link Access Points.
* Reorganize server room.

Most unmentioned tasks in this onsite are done by <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jae Liew'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
