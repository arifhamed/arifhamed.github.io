# 48th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[10:58]</span> omt just simply starting on the poster and report is hard. It would've been much harder without the free references for the posters. They mentioned that examples of the report can be found in Blackboard, but i can't find it for the life of me.

<span class="timestamp">[12:18]</span> So someone from Dell visited the office, here to fix <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ika'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>'s Dell XPS 15.6" laptop. Big laptop. The requirement for me ensure that they do their job is that the laptop is able to make it through Windows login

<span class="timestamp">[12:36]</span> They mentioned that they never changed anything that the laptop was able to boot to their support software without the SSD, but they're not done yet. Still need to go to Windows login and see if successful at booting to Windows. 

<span class="timestamp">[12:41]</span> So chances are, it may be the SSD problem. They can boot on the motherboard without the SSD, yet they can't with it. Right now they are replacing the motherboard of the laptop to see if the replacement of the motherboard would fix it. If the new motherboard cannot boot with the current SSD, then they would report the SSD instead.

<span class="timestamp">[12:47]</span> I am still in shock that IT is not for everyone, because damn, problems happen with a lot devices. Those devices and technology are really required for the advancement for the future. Accounts are not manually written into paper anymore, now it's all (more or less) on Excel sheets! Mail has become much less prevalent with the existence of email, but that comes with the whole trouble of creating connections, setting up an email, ensuring encryption, and so much more.

The thing is, I am still shocked that many people in this generation are still not tech-savvy. They're tech-deaf. They need someone to fix their stuff that will help them advance their business or their productivity. 

I have a friend who works in a bank, and they mentioned how the more manual work are out-sourced to other countries (yup, you guessed it, _India_). Them and their colleagues' job (more or less) is to make sure they do their job right. 

They mentioned that **banking** was the job hotspot that everyone wanted, but now everything is automated with code, with only a few people to make sure the code is working. Now with that, IT became the job hotspot, but from what my friend said, and from what I see too, it may become not so hot soon. Their guess for the next job hotspot is **green energy**, and i kinda see it.

More or less, i don't think i would be fit for green energy. Already touching on physics, nah, nope, i ain't going back. 

I feel like IT in itself also has trends, like, haha, remember BitCoin? I think i might read up on _analog computers..._ 

<span class="timestamp">[13:05]</span> they're still fixing it &#58;&#124;

<span class="timestamp">[13:19]</span> yo the insides of a laptop are so damn complicated. It is only in this internship i truly saw the difference between an M.2 and SATA.

<span class="timestamp">[13:23]</span> yeah no way am i going to be a pro in this industry. All I do is hyper-fixate on my data-hoarding and my collections :') where can that bring me as a career?

<span class="timestamp">[13:48]</span> finally they left <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>, and yeah it was the SSD problem. Now there's a different SSD inside but that one's ours also. 

<span class="timestamp">[16:35]</span> It is Week 10 of my internship and I still have trouble even conceiving the report. Hohoho, damn.

<span class="timestamp">[17:27]</span> Man, so much happened that I wanted to write down to this page in itself. So much. However, I can't say it was totally devoid of productivity. I got started on the report at least, and I also found a previous intern's poster. Remember, <a href="https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-5" target="_blank">FTK Imager</a> is your best friend when you get used devices üòè year 1 in NYP SIT will show you how to use it.

<span class="timestamp">[17:50]</span> aw shucks, now since I found some foundation for my end result, i became complacent and spaced out for an hour <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>.

### What i did today
* Oversaw Dell engineer's analysis of <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ika'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>'s Dell XPS Laptop.
    * Plan: Test if motherboard was spoiled
    * Result: Motherboard was not spoiled, but when attempted to boot with original SSD, it would not boot. When booted with a different SSD (with an existing copy of Windows), it works. SR was emailed to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='support@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
* Enabled forwarding for <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='henry.tan@flexisystems.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='sales@flexisystems.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
* Disabled forwarding for <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='henry.tan@flexisystems.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='sales@flexisystems.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">chocolate sauce<br><br><sup id="1">[1]</sup> finally, my social anxiety lowers. it always happen, whenever i meet at least one new person with no other support there to help me. even if it was someone i knew i would not meet again ever, my every action i must take note to make myself look normal, every sound that existed in the office become deafening, my soul becomes frozen. <br><br>_sigh_, whatever, this happens a lot. I can only look like kind & confident person, but that holds no merit to my tiny scared soul inside of me.<br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> aw shit. Gotta commit tmr to complete the report first. Thank you Swan, a previous <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Infospace'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> intern</span>
