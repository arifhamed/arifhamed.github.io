# Tenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[12:20]</span> I'm just gonna say this, I am glad to have started this blog, because damn, I would've lost my marbles and then some. This blog, alongside YT Vanced, keeps my mind running. Today is Friday, hence I have to right the e-Logs and reflection for this week. If you don't have anything to do, you may as well start the e-Logs and reflection early into the day already. 

Now would be a good time to talk more about the rest of my year. After ITP, I will have FYP right after it, and as of now, I am still trying to get information from friends who have FYP first. Other than 3 months of ITP then 3 months of FYP, I would have a good holiday after that, oh so so sweet. The Promised Land, 2-3 months of holiday. After that holiday wouldn't be so bad either as I have the academic track to finish before graduating. 

I chose Artificial Intelligience, so basically, the RPA that i'm doing in ITP isn't that far for what I would do in the future actually. During the spare time of ITP, I would try to pick up AI early. Better start somewhere, and also to not waste your time.
