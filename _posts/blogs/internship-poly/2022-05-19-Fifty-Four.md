# 54th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[12:44]</span> hahaha aw damn <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. Even though internship is ending soon, i'm still plagued by the deliverables. I mean, sure the report is kinda done and the poster is easy, and the presentation slides should be easy to make, but everything else just creates a great formula of stress.

Ironically, i'm quite awake this morning. I say it's ironic because stress will make me go to a freeze response, which can make my chemistry go funky and make me go lethargic.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> my heart just jumped over the thought of... someone. someone who, for some reason, i just have many feelings for. puberty is still hitting me with the mallet of hormones. This is most odd, because my concern over my internship deliverables should be taking priority. this is madness. oh jesus. i long for intimacy.</span>
