# 43rd day of internship, first bite of the last 3rd piece of the pie

<span class="timestamp">[07:46]</span> alright, that was a nice break, now let's get back to work.

<span class="timestamp">[14:04]</span> perhaps, uh nvm. guess i'll just do the [what i did today](#what-i-did-today)

<span class="timestamp">[17:09]</span> hahaha <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> gotta ask the SIM about that report and poster, like what on unicron is that.

very unrelated but fun fact: on instagram, after unsyncing your IG account and FB account on Meta accounts, not only can you freely name yourself but also give yourself custom genders. Like, i literally identify myself as an _attack helicopter_, and I hope that there will be an instagram update that made it so that the gender shows on your profile, like the pronouns. I wish that one day, custom pronouns will be thing so that people can call me kempeitai.

### What I did today
* A Monthly <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer name&gt;</span> Offsite Backup Check.
    * **NOTE FOR INTERN**: Keep note of the Internship Guidelines, there may be several copies of the files. I could only do this task because I searched for the previous intern's actual latest edited guidelines. I think I will put that as my pass down instead of the one that I was given. The following is how the the basic sequence is:
    1. Make a new email.
        * From: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ia@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company intern email&gt;</span>
        * To: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='alan@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company supervisor email&gt;</span>
            * The 'To' field is set to the supervisor because you need to get their approval first, after that you can switch it out with <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='shirley.lee@acmemonaco.com'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: a customer email&gt;</span>
        * Subject: "Data Offsite Backup check as of [DD MMM YYYY]"
    1. Obtain screenshots of both local & offsite backup via NAS
        1. Open file explorer, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='C:\\Users\\User\\Dropbox\\InfoSpace Common\\Customers\\ACME Monaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file location&gt;</span>, and then open the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco IT info.xlsx'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file name&gt;</span>
        1. Go to the “Server and Network Info.” tab, and under the “NAS'' section, you will see the login information for the NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, as well as NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAOFFSITE'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>
        1. For now, click on the synology quickconnect link for <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, which is <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer quickconnect url&gt;</span>, then login with the credentials that you see, as of writing this the are"
            1. Username: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='infospace'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
            1. Password: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML=';J@Q&V'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
        1. Once logged in, navigate to the "Main Menu", the icon in the top left, and then click on "Hyper Backup", as shown in the guide.
        1. Once in, screenshot the first one. 
    1. After you have pasted the screenshot in the email, you will need to do the steps for the following image.
        1. Using the information found in step 3c, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonacooffsite'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: other customer NAS&gt;</span>, and as of writing this, the credentials are the same as the one above.
        1. After getting in, head to "File Station" which is located on the desktop, and then right click on the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS_1.hbk'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS file&gt;</span>, and click "Open Backup Explorer".
        1. As stated in the guide, you should include the timeline at the bottom of the window when taking the screenshot
        1. Paste it to the email, send to supervisor for approval before sending it to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Shirley'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> HG has been united, and everyone is coming to ONE HOUSE!! Also, isn't as far from home as 2 weeks ago. Love it, absolutely love it. Besides that, I really love to see my cell group at once again, even though i literally saw them 2 days ago for DOC lol. <br><br>Speaking about people, I think I could take this day if there are certain attributes that correlates with my ASD found in any of the relationships I have with these people. Perhaps I would be able to identify further stims that I have when with people. One stim that I notice that I have is stretching my thumb base, and moving my nose cartilage! Someday I should get a kaleidoscope, that would be a great birthday present actually.</span>
