# 43rd day of internship, first bite of the last 3rd piece of the pie

<span class="timestamp">[07:46]</span> alright, that was a nice break, now let's get back to work.

<span class="timestamp">[14:04]</span> perhaps, uh nvm.   

### What I did today
* A Monthly <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer name&gt;</span> Offsite Backup Check.
    * **NOTE FOR INTERN**: Keep note of the Internship Guidelines, there may be several copies of the files. I could only do this task because I searched for the previous intern's actual latest edited guidelines. I think I will put that as my pass down instead of the one that I was given. The following is how the the basic sequence is:
    1. Make a new email.
        * From: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ia@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company intern email&gt;</span>
        * To: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='alan@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: company supervisor email&gt;</span>
            * The 'To' field is set to the supervisor because you need to get their approval first, after that you can switch it out with <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='shirley.lee@acmemonaco.com'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: a customer email&gt;</span>
        * Subject: "Data Offsite Backup check as of [DD MMM YYYY]"
    1. Obtain screenshots of both local & offsite backup via NAS
        1. Open file explorer, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='C:\\Users\\User\\Dropbox\\InfoSpace Common\\Customers\\ACME Monaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file location&gt;</span>, and then open the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco IT info.xlsx'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: reference file name&gt;</span>
        1. Go to the “Server and Network Info.” tab, and under the “NAS'' section, you will see the login information for the NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, as well as NAS <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAOFFSITE'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>
        1. For now, click on the synology quickconnect link for <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS&gt;</span>, which is <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonaco'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer quickconnect url&gt;</span>, then login with the credentials that you see, as of writing this the are"
            1. Username: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='infospace'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
            1. Password: <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML=';J@Q&V'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
        1. Once logged in, navigate to the "Main Menu", the icon in the top left, and then click on "Hyper Backup", as shown in the guide.
        1. Once in, screenshot the first one. 
    1. After you have pasted the screenshot in the email, you will need to do the steps for the following image.
        1. Using the information found in step 3c, go to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://quickconnect.to/acmemonacooffsite'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: other customer NAS&gt;</span>, and as of writing this, the credentials are the same as the one above.
        1. After getting in, head to "File Station" which is located on the desktop, and then right click on the <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='AMANAS_1.hbk'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>: customer NAS file&gt;</span>, and click "Open Backup Explorer".
        1. As stated in the guide, you should include the timeline at the bottom of the window when taking the screenshot
        1. Paste it to the email, send to supervisor for approval before sending it to <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Shirley'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>
