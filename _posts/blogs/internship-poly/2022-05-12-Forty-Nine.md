# 49th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[14:19]</span> mhmhmm, ah a more chill day today :D ytd was mentally hectic.

<span class="timestamp">[16:40]</span> I got 12 working days (including today) for internship, 7 to submit the report & poster üë©üèæ‚Äçü¶Ω I think I need to make an index of topics to actually make this blog useful lmao.

<span class="timestamp">[17:41]</span> aw shucks, and after an hour from the last update, I didn't do even a penny's worth for my deliverables.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">A close friend is under psychological turmoil, and all I know to help them is to be there for them. I have no idea what they are going through, but they are going through a lot. I don't know how to relate, but i really want to help. <br><br>perhaps this is how most people felt when they want to try to help me.<br><br>but for now, i want to help my friend out. they identified me and 2 others as their most trusted individuals. in all honesty, i do not know how to help through text. For now, though, i have to remember that being a compassionate listener is much more important than giving advice.<br><br>its time to help a friend who helped me. that's called the mesh network of God.</span>
