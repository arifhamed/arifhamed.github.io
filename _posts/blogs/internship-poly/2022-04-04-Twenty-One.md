# Twenty-first day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[09:40]</span> I'm not even done with the daily quests yet but i alraedy got a task from Mr. <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Alan Kuik'">Supervisor</span>, so instead of forgetting about it, i gotta record it down of [course](#what-i-did-today).

<span class="timestamp">[10:09]</span> So, uh, word of advice, <span style="font-size:130%">before running any RPA, open the required apps or files first,</span> becaauusse, after typing out my first task here, i found that the RPA did not detect new emails, which meant it marked all the NAS as missing! Don't do that shit, don't mess up the track, which could lead to messing up the RPA.

I'm quite glad that at least, at the very hardcore least, that the UiPath RPA was robust enough to be able to fix up the mistake that occured this morning.

### What i did today
* Change password for <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='chefheman@hilliergroup.com.sg'">&lt;REDACTED: customer email&gt;</span>
    * Updated via <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='https://cp8.infospace.com.sg:8443/'">&lt;REDACTED: company email gui link&gt;</span>
    * Updated IT Information files in <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Infospace'">&lt;REDACTED: itp organization&gt;</span> Storage
* A Monthly <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco'">&lt;REDACTED: customer name&gt;</span> Offsite Backup Check.
    * **NOTE FOR INTERN**: Keep note of the Internship Guidelines, there may be several copies of the files. I could only do this task because I searched for the previous intern's actual latest edited guidelines. I think I will put that as my pass down instead of the one that I was given. The following is how the the basic sequence is:
    * Make a new email.
        * From: <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ia@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;REDACTED: company intern email&gt;</span>
        * To: <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='alan@infospace.com.sg'">&lt;REDACTED: company supervisor email&gt;</span>
            * The 'To' field is set to the supervisor because you need to get their approval first, after that you can switch it out with <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='shirley.lee@acmemonaco.com'">&lt;REDACTED: a customer email&gt;</span>
        * Subject: "Data Offsite Backup check as of [DD MMM YYYY]
    * Obtain screenshots of both local & offsite backup via NAS
        * Open file explorer, go to <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='C:\\Users\\User\\Dropbox\\InfoSpace Common\\Customers\\ACME Monaco'">&lt;REDACTED: reference file location&gt;</span>, and then open the <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='ACME Monaco IT info.xlsx'">&lt;REDACTED: reference file name&gt;</span>
        * Go to the “Server and Network Info.” tab, and under the “NAS'' section, you will see the login information for the NAS AMANAS, as well as NAS AMANAOFFSITE
        * For now, click on the synology quickconnect link for INCOMPLETE:ARIF_LOOK_AGAIN

So, and <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Roy'">my accountable friend</span> knows this well (because damn we got similar problems to a tea), this girl has some red flags that I won't get too much into.--> </span>
