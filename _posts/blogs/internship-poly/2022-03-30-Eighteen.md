# Eighteenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[11:34]</span> I had something in mind, but before that i realised something. This blog is really more for my mind to speak, rather than just about internship. The more i think and write, the more i experience, say, a positive feeling, the embracing of what my mind is, and how it is different. I do not have an illness, i just see and experience the world in a different way. A very different way. That is why this world is just so very mundane. There is no magic, there is no ghosts, there is no supernatural. That is why i chose to follow God.

<span style="font-size:150%;">Anyway...</span>.... i started typing on this timestamp because i realised that office chairs can indeed adjust the angle of the backrest. They were actually all simultaneously locked with the rest set all the way back, and i probably sat weirdly on my chair weirdly one day and the rest snapped up. It was still adjustable, but in the end i figured out that one of the levers on the underside of the chair was what locked it. I'm just stating this here to refute a statement that if maybe i said something against the chairs in this workplace in a previous post (couldn't find it but maybe someone can point it out soon).
