geez, not much this week

---

I will choose to not be verbose in this reflection, though I do not appear to have much of an option. I have a lot to write down, almost none related to internship, almost all related to my current mental health. 

All that I can allow myself to explain of my current situation is that my basic perception of humans in general has been deteriorating. I do not wish to reveal much of this to NYP or <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Infospace'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, as I believe that the only people can truly help me are of the Church. However, be assured that this has not affected my work at all.

So far, everything that has happened this week has been quite trivial, yet I cannot say that it is devoid of change. Outlook on my work PC has stopped working twice per day, and (temporarily) got it working on both days. 

Something that I may pick up from this experience is that in some offices, things can be quite outdated, and I either have to live with it or power through to get everything updated. To my disbelieve, the Outlook on this work PC was working on version 2013, and also this computer is super slow. It really went against my perspective of an IT company, however I shall give some slack as it is quite a small company.

I hope that I will still be expressive for the remaining half of this internship to come, by then my hopes include not to slowly close-up. As I finish writing this, I realised that I still became verbose anyway, how delightful. Thank you for reading this.

On an unrelated note, if anyone has any SSDs that you want to donate or sell at a discount, comment below. As long as its 256 GB or more, that'll be fine by me.
