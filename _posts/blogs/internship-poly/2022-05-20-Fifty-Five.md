# 55th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[13:00]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[14:46]</span> <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> Yo my report and poster are basically done, and it seems like the presentation is just as a copy over from the report and poster. My SIM mentioned it was a..

<span class="timestamp">[15:26]</span> ..formal presentation, so my mind went to imagine a huge auditorium with a large audience. Turns out it was just a zoom presentation. Due to covid forever changing the workplace structures, you as an intern may also have to have a zoom presentation.

<span class="timestamp">[16:09]</span> <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>, well actually, I think I would just do the e-Logs & reflection

<span class="timestamp">[17:45]</span> Damn, finally gonna get a Thinkpad dock, after almost 3 years of owning an X250 that is 7 years old this year.

<pre>
As I write my second last reflection, my concern still overrides my ability to think. Even though I have done my final report & poster, my nerves still stand at end over the final presentation, and the final five days of my internship. I am not sure what to say about it, besides learning to keep myself calm and do what needs to be done, like this e-Logs and reflection for example. 

Technical wise, I have not learnt anything new this week. Nevertheless, I have taken the time to look through the work PC and the office to ensure everything is set alright for the next intern. 

There is nothing much to reflect upon this week, and I foresee that I would not reflect much next week either, unless I learn a new skill by chance. That would be fine by me, however, as it really spices up the day.

If there is one thing I learnt about myself this week, is that I should accept any accommodations that any school, organization or community gives me. All my appreciation and final details can be found in the final report.

Thank you for reading.
</pre>

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> I have been hit by an epiphany. I have meltdowns when things change drastically or if something isn't normal. That first day, all the way back from [7 March](https://arifhamed.com/blogs/internship-poly/2022/03/07), the reason why I was so sad is because it was a huge change. It was a change from something that I was comfortable with, to something I didn't look forward to. That was the first meltdown I ever had. I tried to mask when those kinds of emotions come, but the influx of emotions that day was overwhelming. It all makes sense<br><br>it all makes sense<br>it all makes sense<br>ever since i've been unmasking myself, everything seems to make sense now, everything about myself.<br><br>my life has never been better. thank you God.<br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> i bought this cool pin from the local "happy pin shop", for the 57th day of my internship.<br><br><sup id="3">[3]</sup> My mind keeps on stalling today.
