# Nineteenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[16:15]</span> I think my supervisor is slowly giving me a new task a day, which I really appreciate, like I honestly do. It is really important to not always assume crudely, but I feel like they are considering my <span style="color:black;background-color:black;">ASD</span> into account, ever since the end of week 2. Anyway, i'm just gonna record down that task i did today.

### What I did today
* Convert a PowerPoint file into HTML for <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML = 'http://www.hkntanks.com.sg/'">a customer</span>, for their website (which appears to be new)
