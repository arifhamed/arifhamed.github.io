# First day of internship: The start of 3 months

I will use this first post as a kind-of introduction for my **Internship Training Programme (ITP)**, not much happened in the first day, but i can create a story of how my mind perceived it after the intro

> ITP is a time where almost all polytechnic students go through to gain work experience and get a grip and taste of what real-life is working in their industry. IT is my industry, hence I got posted to an IT company that serves IT to other companies as an intern (obviously), and from there I will get to learn a lot of things. So far, I don't think I got to hear of my entire scope, but nothing doesn't seem to characteristic so far

### How it went
As I walked from Promenade to Suntec City Boulevard after a journey from my humble home of _Sengkang_ to _Little India_, and from _Little India_ to _Promenade_, my heart was still in large uncertainty and anxiety. Not taking up this opportunity I can see it as freedom, but i'd rather not limit my chances of geting through poly, nor will I ever want to become a _neet_. 

Albeit, the employer (probably not the accurate term for what his role is in my ITP but for convenience i'm just gonna call him that) was late, and I was like `aight`, first guy i met in that cold office was some guy who thought the new intern was female. My friends thought it was funny, and so do I

When the employer came by at around 0905 or so, he introduced almost all that I had to do in the office and in customer sites. By the way, the company is tiny, like I think it is just one room, and the company just consists of 3 engineers and 1 person who WFH and consists of HR and Finance. Oh and the intern, which is **me** for the next 12 weeks.

After being introduced to the room by the employer (who is one of the engineers), he left at some point, leaving behind just me, this laptop and a work pc. I though `wow, this is gonna be life for the next 3 months`. Just me, the occasional visits by the engineers, and an internal chat group where the engineers get in some updates about their work sites and all. I, as the intern, get to text once per day, minimum, to that group, which is a report of the network storages for the company's clients.

Something was behind my eyes throughout the day though. There was not much that was happening that day, and I was just getting started at understanding what the company was about..

Today was a quite a day, one day down out of...  60 working days (84 including weekends, oh and also, I took the 3 months route)

Thank you for reading this blog, I will keep on doing this from 7 March 2022 to 27 May 2022. This blog is for my successor interns after me, and how I handled it
