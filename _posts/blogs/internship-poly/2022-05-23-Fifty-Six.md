# 56th day of internship, first ever WFH

<span class="timestamp">[17:54]</span> so here's a fun fact: today was my first work-from-home! and wow, its such an indescribable feeling! Like, you're at home, but you're still technically working! For you as an intern, and especially nowadays with the COVID situation almost going back to normal, it would be insanely difficult for you to get this experience. No doubt <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> would ask you why, then proceed to only depend on the fact that, the day you are WFH..

<span class="timestamp">[23:02]</span> ..someone else must be in office. Also, yes, wow, really got distracted halfway. I decided to prioritize the presentation actually, perhaps i would develop a script, because its really skeletal. its the execution that really matters imo.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">i'm salty over the fact that my hg leader only recognized recently that the fact that my internship limits my ability to prepare it. recently, like, last week. this is my last week. i feel so cheated. i feel like i bought a lap<br><br><sup href='1'>[1]</sup> i'm so emotionally gone and tired. it's not even the work. ugh. the world hurts, and no one understands.</span>
