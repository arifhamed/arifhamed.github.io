<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> i know for a fact that this stress, this murderous and deathly despair. doesn't come from work. i could think of a few reasons, perhaps one of it is the racing truck of life that holds the concept of what growing up into an adult is like. <br><br>even though i only hold a very minor role in this upcoming easter production, i still feel some invisible intense pressure. this makes no sense. i was villains, _pharisees_ with lines of dialogue, and there was so much more blocking and training! all i was this friday and sunday was just a <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='police officer'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> with just 2 lines and a finale song at the end. it was the a role that i very much enjoy. So why-<br><br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> so i knocked out, and woke up just in time for our supervisor to mention to us that some spare birthday cake was coming out way, so that's pretty neat. I'm beginning to think my internal self-torment was starting to take a toll on my energy, hence the repetitive naps that occured multiple times recently. jesus f. christ, what is happening to me.<br><br>i think.<br>no.<br>i know that what is happening right now is spiritual warfare. hell wants more victims, and this upcoming easter bottlenecks their efforts for eternal damnation. <br><br>God, if you hear this, guide me to know what to do. the directors have shared of how many people leave church after participating in a production, and i do not want to be next statistic. I do not want to let my own mind or the world dictate my actions or life.<br><br>i can say many times that i will do this or that, but i just want to truly live that life. i just want to live that life that God wants me to have. <br><br>i admit, i have been chasing the wrong things when my life starts to suck. i understand how that eventually kill someone, a slow fade. i saw first-hand how someone can just almost disappear one day. It's not just one day, it's a process that happens over a long while. this links to a lack that one has in their relationship with God, and I know exactly what that is. i've been looking at the wrong things for this lack.<br><br>now i just not only understand and say it,<br>but,<br>yes,<br>oh i can see it now<br><br>i stumbled and fell, breaking into multiple pieces, all in a mess. but the one thing that i couldn't figure out was that **intimacy and grace of God**. how could i forget<br><br>i considered going missing because i thought i didn't deserve to be with the body of Christ, i felt lost. i was blind. but<br><br>they still cared, like how God still cares for me even right now. even if i messed up, even if i lash back, even if i hurt people. <br><br>i'd never knew that, this easter's message is also for me, God's Unfolding Love. <br><br><br>I know for a fact that battles like this won't end, and i'm pretty sure i am like this everytime i get into this kind of position, i just kept silent about it, bottled it up, and hide it, as i would do about most emotions i had as a child with ASD. not anymore. <br><br><br>If you're reading this, brothers and sisters, i may or may not be super ok as of this typing, but please, talk to me. remind me how God and community still values me as part of the body of Christ. sorry if you noticed i had ghosted for a bit from any of you, i just needed time. <br><br>To me right now, all this isn't a solid answer, but if you can be patient with me, i may be able to explain what's in my mind to the best of my abilities. <br><br>good lord, i feel better now</span>
