_**...and my reflection...**_

---
---

The beginning of this new month has arrived quite smoothly. I am fresh out of inspiration to insert every bit and piece of my mind upon this box of text, I shall just simply refer to the guide above.

Admittedly I have not met anyone new in this internship besides the ones I have been in contact with and the ones in the first week. 

The only advances that I have made in my life this week (albeit very little) will go into somewhat religious aspect of my faith of Christianity, and I believe that it is not appropriate to simply record this down in a reflection for internship. 

There is this tablet on the table that I existed before I came to this internship, where the previous intern was working on it. Today (Friday), I decided to clean the screen, charge it up & turn it on, and look at its specifications. It was a nice looking gadget, even more so as it fit some accessories for mobile devices that I happen to carry on today.

Nevertheless, I cannot deny that I did do something new this week, referring to the recorded daily tasks. I believe that this the minimum that this can go. However, I can't help but think that perhaps my internship supervisor is looking out for me, after it was revealed to him that I had a condition, a certain disorder.

Maybe this is just my own misguided sentimentalism. As much as I embrace my disorder, everyone has still have a small desire to fit in. Everyone in my secondary school can tell you that. 

Next up in my itinerary of concerns is whether or not Good Friday is a valid holiday for me as an intern to partake in.

<span class="timestamp">[16:50]</span> ...and submitted.. It always feels good to do that at the end of every week. My gosh this internship is like RP times by 5 HAHA and damn, what an inside joke for singaporeans. I wonder if people in rp needs to write a reflection everyday even in internship. Oh lord, my meticulousness will kill me like that. Now I <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='can finally buy that nice chicken cheese bread'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">Once again, prayer meeting back at HCC! Promenade to HCC is pretty close, ngl. Still though, Good Friday is next week, so God help me and the cast & crew. It is already here! ohohohoho<br><br>Now on more solemn news, I have this friend. I really care for them a lot, and they have been in and out of this state of missingness and depression, and then coming back to us as if nothing happened. Unlike my care, I had zero clue what was happening to them. I dare not provide more details upon this post but it is up to those who are accountable with them to keep on praying for them. Our leader revealed that, perhaps, their behaviour is linked to something about accountability, which somwhat relates to the next subject.<br><br> Something else that I decided to partake in is that me and a good friend (different one) made a purity pact yesterday night, and so far, I am quite successful, even though throughout the hours here on my own, my own mind has been trying cut down my resolve. Today was quite tormenting, especially since the last 2 days I have been alone in this office.<br><br>With everything, though, my God still stands. Every day at 9am, I get to spend some time making a prayer for the day, and no doubt that is what kept both my sanity and purity intact. This is going to be a treacherous journey, as mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2: 9-12, but there will be hope.<br><br><span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='there will be hope, jeanette. do not let your feelings overtake you'">there will be hope</span></span>
