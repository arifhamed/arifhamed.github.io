# 47th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[10:58]</span> I had a terrible start today. So i woke up in agony, and probably spent an hour on the loo because i ate something super mcspicy ytd, and my insides just wanted to change their politcal leaders inside of me. It's like the Philippines election that's gonna happen soon and my digestive system is the voting booth.. 

Not only that, Outlook was just being an absolute jerk and wouldn't run for 3 minutes without it crashing, until just now since the backup track was able to run and I was finally able to send that damn whatsapp report, later than usual. 

My insides were/are still in turmoil because I keep on worrying about the onsite visit later to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Eximdis (new client)'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. At the very least, there is <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jae'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> there to accompany me, they seem to be a nice person. 

On that last one though, at least that that's something that I can put on as a daily task. Perhaps it would be like my first week when I went to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='TAK Products & Services'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, except that it is just today, and I don't have to go to Yew Tee by 8am, and there is someone in this company to guide me. Sigficantly better outlook, i must say. <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[22:36]</span> So as it turns out, pretty chill. It was just walking distance from Ubi MRT, and the office was pretty neat. I learned this pretty handy tool called the wire tracker. More details below on that. All the trip was about was just changing some stuff so that the new company would be able to settle in. Also, going onsite will give a higher chance of going home earlier, ended work an hour earlier ðŸ¤©

It seems my digestive system also finished slaying the spice demon that i ate yesterday.

### What i did today
* <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Eximdis'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> onsite
    * Learn what a wire tracker is and how it works. This is my interpretation: 
        * Consists of two parts, the signaller and the receiver. Connect any network cable (either RJ11 or RJ45) and the signaller will send a signal through the cable when turned on. 
        * Test the receiver. If it makes a beep boop sound when the tip is near and turned on, than that means the connection for that wire is working. It is otherwise if the receiver just makes static when turned on.
        * Most of the time, you would use this in infrastructure like an office, to see if a LAN port is connected and functioning to the server room for example. The parts would work in tandem usually far apart.
        * Most of the time, there could be a lot of cables in a switch (like in thie office) and it may be necessary to test each cable for the signal. If the signal is still picked up in a bunch of wires, then that means that the connection works and depending on the task, there may be no need to test each cable from there.
    * Install TP-Link Access Points.
    * Reorganize server room.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> I can't help but think that they should do this with every intern with ASD. Maybe once or twice in their entire internship. It's a way of dipping their toes into employment, really. <br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> Gosh, why do I worry so much? That really is part of ASD. Today's onsite work interrupts my routine, and its devastating. Ever since last week, everyday I have pondered over the actual implications if I ever end up in this kind of industry. Do I really want to do IT as a career? <br><br>my future is undetermined, so by His grace & mercy He has it.</span>
