# 47th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[10:58]</span> I had a terrible start today. So i woke up in agony, and probably spent an hour on the loo because i ate something super mcspicy ytd, and my insides just wanted to change their politcal leaders inside of me. It's like the Philippines election that's gonna happen soon and my digestive system is the voting booth.. 

Not only that, Outlook was just being an absolute jerk and wouldn't run for 3 minutes without it crashing, until just now since the backup track was able to run and I was finally able to send that damn whatsapp report, later than usual. 

My insides were/are still in turmoil because I keep on worrying about the onsite visit later to <span class='disable-selection' ondbclick="this.innerHTML='Eximdis (new customer)'"><**REDACTED**></span>. At the very least, there is <span class='disable-selection' ondbclick="this.innerHTML='Jae'"><**REDACTED**></span> there to accompany me, they seem to be a nice person. 

On that last one though, at least that that's something that I can put on as a daily task. Perhaps it would be like my first week when I went to <span class='disable-selection' ondbclick="this.innerHTML='TAK Products & Services'"><**REDACTED**></span>, except that it is just today, and I don't have to go to Yew Tee by 8am, and there is someone in this company to guide me. Sigficantly better outlook, i must say. <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> I can't help but think that they should do this with every intern with ASD. Maybe once or twice in their entire internship. It's a way of dipping their toes into employment, really. </span>
