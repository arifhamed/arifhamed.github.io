# 52nd day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[17:52]</span> It felt like I did virtually nothing, but technically I did things that deviate from nothingness. Still dumb-founded about the presentation though.

### What I did today
* Visited <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='TwinGlobal'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> to return <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ika'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>'s laptop
* Went down and gave <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Mr Alan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> who was driving:
    * 1 Dell laptop (from the remaining stock)
    * 1 Dell essentials laptop bag (from the remaining stock)
