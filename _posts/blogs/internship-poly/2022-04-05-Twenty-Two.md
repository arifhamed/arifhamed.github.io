# 22nd day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[10:38]</span> As you see above there, i just decided to switch to numbers cuz the full style words from twenty one are just ridiculous.

<span class="timestamp">[17:12]</span> So, i've been stoning and thinking, and i realised that after some time, doing this blog doesn't become second nature. idk, perhaps i'm just tired, from doing nothing. perhaps i might die early in life idk. i hope not though. 

i need <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='God'">humans & their interaction</span>.

{% include comments.html url=page.url %}

<input id="password-input" type="password" class="text-secret" onkeyup="unlock()" autocomplete="off">

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">Today is one of those days where Easter closes in, and we have to have rehearsals in the weekdays. God help us, because damn, just one moment later, Easter is next week! To be frank, I am quite glad it's going to end soon, perhaps finally get to meet some people that i've wanted to meet again in a while.<br><br>on unrelated news, idk why but, <span class="disable-selection" ondblclick="this.innerHTML='my desire to have a relationship is peaking, and i do not know why. Perhaps it is my own realisation that i have become more mature, internally & externally? Perhaps it is the lack of human interaction? No, that cannot be. I have no idea what it could be but my feelings are all over the place for certain people. perhaps, getting to vent to Roy about this is the best course of action.'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span></span>
