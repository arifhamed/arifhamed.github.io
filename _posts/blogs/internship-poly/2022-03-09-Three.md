# Third day of internship

Today was the same office, and what I did was a bit similar for today. Nothing much different except what i learnnt to do.

### Some things I learnt
* Clone storages, from HDD to SSD, using Macrium and some piece of machine that can hold 2 SSDs, and connect to a PC. It is a pretty interesting device, i wish i got its name.
* Add users to admin (kinda learnt that one in a module last year actually)

<span class="disable-selection" id="load-text" style="display:none;">..besides going to harvest group. I love getting to that sharing question part, especially since that it can and will almost always relate to my current season. <br><br>What do i need to let go in order to truly rest and celebrate in the Sabbath?<br>This is a question for all working Christians to answer (not excluding other walks of life). Hope keeps on going!</span>
