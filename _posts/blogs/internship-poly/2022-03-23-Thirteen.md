# Thirteenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[14:22]</span> So i've been thinking, i think i'm quite burned out from creating the RPA.

<span class="timestamp">[17:46]</span> Status update: nothing new, just wanted to write something before work ends.

### What I did today
* Diagnose UiPath RPA for some issues
    * Some NAS that are being recorded in the RPA spreadsheet would have their status not recorded in the current week, but the RPA would likely fill up those 7 slots for that NAS with `Missing` for the previous week, if ran on the current week. For cases like this now, just manually check each affected NAS emails in Outlook.
    * Status: !urgent, !important, !finished
* Lookup if Synology DS918+ supports dual power supply
    * it doesn't seem like it (<a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/18-year/DS918+/enu/Synology_DS918_Plus_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>)
