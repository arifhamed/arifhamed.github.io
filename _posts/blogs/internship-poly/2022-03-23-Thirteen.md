# Thirteenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[14:22]</span> So i've been thinking, i think i'm quite burned out from creating the RPA.

### What I did today
* Diagnose UiPath RPA for some issues
    * Some NAS that are being recorded in the RPA spreadsheet would have their status not recorded in the current week, but the RPA would likely fill up those 7 slots for that NAS with `Missing` for the previous week, if ran on the current week. For cases like this now, just manually check each affected NAS emails in Outlook.
    * Status: !urgent, !important, !finished
