# 44th day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[14:45]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[17:01]</span> I have so many ideas for, like, my own like cartoon comics, but i have no inspiration nor skill to draw it out. 

I just realised that each hour of the clock that comes different feelings for each day.

I noticed <a href="https://github.com/daniel-life" target="_blank">my friend</a> hasn't updated <a href="https://daniel-life.github.io/" target="_blank">his website</a> since 2 April, perhaps he ended up using wix or wordpress instead. Meanwhile, here I am, with a annually-paid [DNS](https://arifhamed.com) from Google, and <a href="https://arifhamed.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">tumblr</a>, among other [social media](https://arifhamed.com/about).

I'm not sure if I have mentioned in a previous post, but up until some point recently last week I updated this website from using <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank">utteranc.es</a>, which is nice and all but it requires users to have a GitHub account, to using <a href="https://jdvp.me/articles/Google-Forms-Jekyll-Comments-Revisited" target="_blank">Google Forms</a>, built for static sites, especially Jekyll. If you try hard enough, you can actually find my Google Sheet containing all of the comments of this website.

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> Recently i've been finding out more about myself, as it turns out, i've been stimming a lot, subconsciously, without stim tools. Here's the list that i've been able to identify so far:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; pushing my nose up<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; verticle squatting so that my ankle could make a sound sometimes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; eating the buns of a burger/tortilla of a wrap first then the rest of the inside<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; listening to the same music over and over<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; hugging something<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; seeing something download for a while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#149; probably much more<br><br>I'm not sure if i could have a strong emotional attachment with people, but idk, maybe i do i just don't know, yet. Also i've read something about autism and sexuality, and i found out that perhaps my small aspects of femininity aren't by coincidence. I realized that back then I don't really care for gender roles. <span ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Maybe i am pansexual. i will love anyone in their own sexual identity once i get to know them deeply.'">I'm straight, for the record hahaha.</span> I mean, yeah, just to note that if you yourself encounter another autistic person. <br><br>Autistic people will find it pleasant if you read up about their condition before meeting them, except don't expect them to be as exactly as what you read up. Everyone is different, so are people with autism.<br><br>I am different.<br><br><sup id="2">[2]</sup> man what on earth am i typing</span>
