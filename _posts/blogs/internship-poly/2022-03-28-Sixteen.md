# Sixteenth day of internship

<span class="timestamp">[09:55]</span> For the first time, I decided to scan the hardcopy service reports. With the internship guidelines, it was quite easy, and it works too.

One thing that I want to do today though is to rewrite that internship guidelines, make it much more easy to read. Don't get me wrong, it's fine, it's just me.

### What I did today
* Save hardcopy service reports to &lt;**REDACTED**&gt; storage, using printer's scanner. 
    * Used internship guidelines for help. 10/10 very useful and straightforward
