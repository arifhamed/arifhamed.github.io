<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML=''">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

if there is one thing that I notice about having a crush, it would be developed by spending more time with them. today, my feelings leaned towards <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='qj3heq'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>. I almost spent the whole day with her, kinda. We were both <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='f9dqo8w5w r94 6975y'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> Service just now. Gosh, her entire being. Such an amazing human being, someone who wants to listen to you, someone who just is full of fire. 

nevertheless, i know for a fact that my feelings will change again. she's definitely one to keep an eye out though. if we end up together, my life will be forever in blessing. i want to bless her too

i should, haha

i should go back to origami again hahaha
