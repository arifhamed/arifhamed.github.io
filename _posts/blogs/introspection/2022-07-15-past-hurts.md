preface:
* time period: entire day
* topic(s): disconnected mind, haunting past


what a weird pain it was yesterday. the sudden fever in the morning. it could also be because i accidentally broke my thinkpad, which is among something that I really loved, and it will be missed. i mean, i could just get a new fan, but what with the money to get a new internal fan, it could further discount the next thinkpad I may intend to get. but alas, this is all but materialism. i don't need another laptop. it's weird though, because i told myself that last time before getting the C640 i have now. i can hear everyone telling me already that i don't need another laptop. anything thinkpad was of high value to me. in fact, watching ltt's video on the anniversay thinkpad kinda felt like a farewell to my X250. perhaps, it's time to move on, even though now i also have 2 ultradocks now. whatevs, the gpd is what my eyes are on now.

but this page isn't about lenovo's laptops. it's about today and my disconnection from reality.

i think it started yesterday, i hope that it was just that fever that broke me. right now, my mind is at a constant state of going in and out, between the real world and my head.

what is in my head? to think it were anything positive, that would be such a godsend..

my mind kept on impaling itself with intrusive thoughts. it kept on rewinding and rewinding the past, and pushed me to the edge. it tells me everything that i've done wrong, everything. everything. Everything. because of this, i could not do any work or anything else productive. and that just cycles and spirals down to me blaming myself for everything.

today i remained at home instead of coming to school, as i was afraid that the immense fever and headache would rise again if i went back to school. alas, it did not. today was fine. it was until about evening however, where my temperature started to rise and my cranium felt it was swelling again. i wasn't sure what to do. i was about to text my leader too. i had the text saying that the fever yesterday had come back.

but some reason, like a goddamn idiot, i pushed myself to go.

it was not the going that was bad, it was the fact that i did not communicate with anyone else about this predicament. i was not rational, and it hurts me a lot to think of the absence of thought in that moment. 

i just don't understand why, why i cannot think for myself. i just can't, and it feels hopeless.

i came to that place for about 20min, then came back. such a fucking waste of time, for both me and everyone else. they would've been better off without me.

[2245] all this were my thoughts earlier, i tried to relay what exactly was my thoughts, but i didn't want to take out my laptop in the middle of a short bus & train ride home.

my mind is still riddled with the intrusive thoughts about the past, though right now in this moment it's a bit better.

during that short time i was there, i realized that there were some troubles that i never realized i had for a long time. one of which is that sometimes i don't understand or couldn't process in time what person on stage was saying, especially if it's a prayer and they're saying it too fast. something like that just leaves me in confusion.

my gosh, now my mind is branching out many scenarios and opinions about this. one prominent one is that if i kept on asking for help, no one would want to help me again. this one makes sense, but to learn another social skill again.. ..it took me such a long time to learn how to strike up a conversation, probably at least a decade after knowing how to read and write.

being attacked by my own part of me is just tiring, and painful. it's not even by choice. one day, if i just keep on ignoring myself, i would just explode into a million pieces, sliting everyone who ever knew me.

God, just why. i feel another episode coming. 

no one would understand. people say they understand, but facing certain problems we share is nothing for them. and i hate how people around me just have life easier. it took the graces of people who actually care to show that what i have is an actual disorder, and that other people also face it. 

perhaps this is why i never write down so much, or if i do have an idea, it would just be a jumbled mess like this. man i hate this, i hate this, i hate myself, i hate my entire life. i don't know anymore. i don't want to write the same shit everytime, complaining about how mysteriously fucked and different i am, every day of this asshole life. i'm sone, screw it. no one will understand what i wrote here anyway, and when you ask me, i would not be able to answer either. i'm done.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

with everything, i wonder what kind of masterpiece i am. i really do want to reach perfection, reach where God wants me to be, see Him use my talents for His purpose.

and in tears, there will be peace
