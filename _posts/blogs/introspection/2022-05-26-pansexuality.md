Pansexuality. Ever since a few years ago, I first heard of this term and I kinda put it aside for a while, until I realized I had a sexual attraction to not just girls, but also of any other people, regardless of their sexual identity. It may have a link to my ASD, where in my life, it made me see how little value there is in social norms/constructs. That is why I don't give a shit about whether or not someone has feelings about a person of the same gender or identifies as a certain gender. I knew I wasn't bisexual because i'm attracted to any people beyond the 2 biological genders.

Do I have much to say about this? No, not really. I know that I would more or less end up with a lady as my soul partner, plus homosexual intercourse is absolutely illegal in Singapore here (typing this as of 26 May 2022). I came out to my friends on 24 May 2022, but I think they didn't get the idea of what the flag or symbol was, except one that asked me for clarification, and one that asked me if I was okay? I was a bit confused by the latter because, well, in this aspect, there is nothing wrong with me. The best response to my coming out was my sister.

Well, I got thing else much to say. If you want to know more, just google it, or just ask me.
