# Tenth day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[14:34]</span> i.. i hate design, i hate figma, i hate doing something like this. Gosh, no wonder i hated animation when i tried it long ago. Yeah perhaps animation is easier than this but i ain't gonna do it. Gosh, the only reason why i'm even in school (physically) now <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> is because of 2 reasons:

1. I want to finish next week's work first
1. I already have some ideas for a new non-interactive prototype

[Unrelated] kny is so awesome to watch, just like opm.

<span class="timestamp">[15:25]</span> [Unrelated] i, oh my shit, i decided use the remaining time to install custom Windows in the existing partition.
