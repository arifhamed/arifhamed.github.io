# Seventeenth day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[10:55]</span> Now you might be wondering why the last 3 school schooldays redirected here. That's because those three days, updating this blog has been off my mine for some reason, and more or less the possibility of a psychotic break was available in this time period. It wasn't close, but that cursed door is open. Either way, I think I will try to update daily as much as I can, though I can't guarantee that. 

All I can say is: John 15:7

The words behind that piece of text will make me sane for the rest of my days <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.

<span class="timestamp">[11:22]</span> Today is the first day i bring my X250 (running Zorin OS Lite) to the FYP Labs! Here are some things I noticed:
* The travel hub that I used to bring around can only connect to USB-C, which this laptop doesn't have (you can tell how old this laptop is already), but this laptop already came with some [pretty useful I/O](/) (link doesn't work yet, take note arif).

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><sup id="1">[1]</sup> and my God, that hug-percut of affirmation from God. That scripture wasn't even shared in the sermon that day but the theme was definitely related to it. Every week, i pray with my friends that the word will speak, but that sermon hit differently, like it was a power-up. <br><br>i was blasphemous for assuming that God would forsake me. </span>
