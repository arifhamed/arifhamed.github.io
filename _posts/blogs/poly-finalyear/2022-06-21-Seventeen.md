# Seventeenth day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[10:55]</span> Yup, this is me. Now you might be wondering why the last 4 school schooldays redirected here. That's because those three days, updating this blog has been off my mine for some reason, and more or less the possibility of a psychotic break was available in this time period. It wasn't close, but that cursed door is open. Either way, I think I will try to update daily as much as I can, though I can't guarantee that. 

All I can say is: John 15:7

The words behind that piece of text will make me sane for the rest of my days <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.

<span class="timestamp">[11:22]</span> Today is the first day i bring my X250 (running Zorin OS Lite) to the FYP Labs! Here are some things I noticed:
* The travel hub that I used to bring around can only connect to USB-C, which this laptop doesn't have (you can tell how old this laptop is already), but this laptop already came with some [pretty useful I/O](/) (link doesn't work yet, take note arif).
    * The way the LAN cable just connects right there like that, like, it's majestic..


<span class="timestamp">[13:35]</span> i'm a bit baffled and concerned. These people are just leaving by their own will, but the afaik, the spot checks has not been conducted yet. One concern about the spot checks that usually happen on Tuesday is that it may occur later in the day, or it already happened in the first 10min of the 9hr of FYP today, since 9am. 

The worst case scenario is that they turn from regular to random, and yes, I misread the first time, turns out it was _regular_ spot checks, not random spot checks. well, I hope it still is regular, just like a drink.

<span class="timestamp">[15:39]</span> i'm glad to have reserved that other half of the waffle, i'm gonna eat it at 4pm, and I hope that there won't be a coincidental spot-check by then. 

<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jovan'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> and their projectmate left, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ellyiana'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> left, I didn't even see<span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Jun Jie'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> today, and I hear the loud fellow FYPJers behind me contemplate about just leaving too. I'm starting to think that maybe they have their own methods of "_being present_"...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunate for them!

I'm still skeptical though, i'm staying until 5:45pm, just like <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/? search=Matthew%2024%3A43&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 24:43</a>.

Besides, there is barely any difference if I wasn't in school anyway. What I needed to do was to make this time period useful, so i decided to simply start creating the [Logitech Unifying Catalog](/resources/logitech-unifying) 

<span class="timestamp">[16:13]</span> the person behind me said, "_why fyp so boring?_",like, yeah, it do be like that sometimes.

<span class="timestamp">[16:59]</span> so in the fyp lab, like, when i'm not plugged in to earpieces to focus, i hear someone else's version of "hey dude" or "friend". they say "my brother in christ", and then proceeds to say "what the &lt;vulgarity&gt; is this &lt;their project-related stuff&gt;". they have said this at repetitively today, just today, there is no way i'm making this up. this is just too funny.

also, crapulus, i forgot to wolf on the waffle.

una cosa m√°s, i'm starting to think that maybe there is no spot-check today, like wth.

hmm..

That scripture wasn't even shared in the sermon that day but the theme was definitely related to it. Every week, i pray with my friends that the word will speak, but that sermon hit differently, like it was a power-up. <br><br>i was blasphemous for assuming that God would forsake me. </span>
