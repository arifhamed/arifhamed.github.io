# 22nd day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[11:43]</span> made some [scary](/funky) changes to this website, and yes, there is indeed another redirect. Nothing really interesting happened recently, besides being able to get 10 people to test before the end of 26 June. Tomorrow me and my team are going to <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Pasir Ris Primary'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> to conduct interviews with students and parents. I hope that it goes well

[Unrelated] i've played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/" target="_blank">Celeste</a> recently, and my gosh, i couldn't have related so much with the main character. In fact, that's something that everyone could relate too, except it would hit harder for those suffering with mental issues/illness such as _depression_, _ADHD_, _OCD_, _**autism**_ (especially those without learning disabilities), etc. The story element for that game is not what i expected at all. I would absolutely recommend it. Such a well-chiseled game, like it's meant for many types of gamers: story-driven, action-driven, speed-runners. I'm more of a story driven person myself. CHECK IT OUT!!! :D (as of this typing it's on sale right now)

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;">Throughout my time though, i've began to think more about my autism. The visit to IMH on Friday (which was really fast btw) cemented the fact that I didn't need to go to NS, which saves 2 years of my life for me, but now my uncertainty of the future comes closer too. There is a lot that goes through this head, so much that there is no way i could possibly write it all down.<br><br>perhaps, for a long, long time, i have considered creating my own, like, IG account related to my autism, and perhaps also for how Christianity helps too. I need to root myself in God in order to live this life full of sufferring, especially now even more so there is a **part of me** who is also out to kill me.</span>
