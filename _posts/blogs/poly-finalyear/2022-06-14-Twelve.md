# Twelfth day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[07:39]</span> bleh

<span class="timestamp">[10:31]</span> yo bruh, caught the spot-check. The person still checking right now but thank goodness i wasn't outside eating a pineapple tart. 

so it indeed, it does seem like it's every tuesday 

<span class="timestamp">[14:43]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> i actually ate the tart after the spot check btw. damn delicious.

And going back to my prototype, I got something, at the very least. Thank goodness, but i still gotta tell my supervisor my inadequacy.

<span class="timestamp">[17:37]</span> i actually got a different task! thank You God <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>, and thank you <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='Ms Lauren'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span> for giving me the new **Prototype Testing** task. So instead of creating the design, i now i have to test the prototype on some people already, get 10 people to test it, due on 24 June.

<span class="timestamp">[18:00]</span> you know, i was still able to squeeze out 1 more page today, totalling to 1.5 because that page today was incomplete lmao. 

today is a day that is better, and <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='i don\'t feel like jumping off a building as much as usual'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>.
