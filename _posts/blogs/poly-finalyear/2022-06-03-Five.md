# 5th day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[10:18]</span> so i just the greatest idea, so much so that i will consider it next week, so much so that i will keep this silent as of this posting, because <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='i wonder, i really wondered, if they have ever considered us to use <a href=\'https://remotedesktop.google.com/\' target=\'_blank\'>Chrome Remote Desktop</a>. I think the fact that they even allow it to run in the work laptop, is for those who have COVID or something. i think that\'s what Ellyiana did on Tuesday, though unfortunately for her, there was a spot check that day.'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

I witnessed, my acquaintence, just frackin' playing solitaire, on their laptop. That's pretty cool, i guess.
