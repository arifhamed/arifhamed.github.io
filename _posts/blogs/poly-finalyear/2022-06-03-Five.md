# 5th day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[10:18]</span> so i just the greatest idea, so much so that i will consider it next week, so much so that i will keep this silent as of this posting, because <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='i wonder, i really wondered, if they have ever considered us to use <a href=\'https://remotedesktop.google.com/\' target=\'_blank\'>Chrome Remote Desktop</a>. I think the fact that they even allow it to run in the work laptop, is for those who have COVID or something. i think that\'s what Ellyiana did on Tuesday, though unfortunately for her, there was a spot check that day.'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>

I witnessed, my acquaintence, just frackin' playing solitaire, on their laptop. That's pretty cool, i guess.

<span class="timestamp">[14:10]</span> just created a new guide for [Lockdown Browser](/guides/respondus-lockdown-browser). It works but due to how distasteful it is i didn't include it in the nav (i would probably just create a central guides page)

<span class="timestamp">[16:02]</span> So apparently there was a **compulsory** lecture that **all FYP students** must attend, and as they left, THEY DIDN'T NOTICE ME. LIKE, is it that frackin' hard to realize that oH, tHaT GuY Is sTiLl tHeRe wE ShOuLd tElL HiM, but not even my own PROJECT MEMBERs said ANYTHING. 

Alas, they said they didn't take attendance, but it still leaves a <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='fuck'">****</span>ing bad impression on these people. The fault also partially leaves on me because I didn't check the school email, which i mean, sure, still sucks ass. My memory is worse than a goldfish <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>.

<span class="timestamp">[17:26]</span> Today is a bit.. undesirable. Thank goodness i found CRD.
