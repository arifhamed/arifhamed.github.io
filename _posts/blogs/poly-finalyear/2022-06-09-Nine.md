# Ninth day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[10:13]</span> <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[15:47]</span> ok, the for the entire day until now (for some reason), i just didn't have the effort to work on a new prototype, until i got some ideas, <span class='disable-selection' ondblclick="this.innerHTML='the first one is that the Parent\'s app, the first page when loggin in should be, like, \'child\'s next meal\', and that page will just show whats next, maybe go to other pages'">&lt;<b>REDACTED</b>&gt;</span>, but no interaction yet.

<span class="timestamp">[16:00]</span> unrelated to fyp, but i remembered my laxatives will expire on 2025, and i hadn't sent any bombs to the oceans, and even though i had the laxatives ytd, it's starting to kick in right now

<span class="timestamp">[16:55]</span> [Unrelated]: and i think i'll use that tag whenever there is something that isn't related to FYPJ in any way. Anyway, i really want to stitch a mousepad to my laptop sleeve. 

<span class="timestamp">[17:07]</span> If there is a trend that i noticed for a few days now, is that some people just choose to leave at 5pm already. I would've left too tbh, but i got some people to meet after today so i can afford to stay back. [Unrelated]: I just checked WhatsApp, and i swear, almost everyday i have a friend who always uses WhatsApp Status to post and literally simp to Lisa Simpson. Yeah you read that right. Lisa Simpson. Of all people/characters in media, he chose to simp over that one. I mean, sure, i won't judge, it's just a really special and different interests. <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>

<span class="timestamp">[17:54]</span> omg <sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>
