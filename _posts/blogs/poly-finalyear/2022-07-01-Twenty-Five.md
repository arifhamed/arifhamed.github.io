# 25 day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[13:20]</span> Huh, that's weird. Before reformatting my SSD to be my boot drive, i seem to have forgotten to update my website with some updates, and i lost my page for yesterday that i wanted to post. 

ANYWAYYY, TODAY IS A NEW DAY, AND I AM GLAD TO BE ALIVE!!!!

I read somewhere, that sometimes you need your feelings hurt so that you can wake up & focus on you. Yesterday, everything hurt. Today (and hopefully for a longer while), i can focus on me.

I don't remember everything that I wrote down on the missing page yesterday, but tl;dr, i was not in a good place. That place is still in me, but the greatest joy that was brought to me today was that my body and soul still has the will to live another day <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<span class="timestamp">[14:48]</span> yikes, too much noise today already, and energy dropped as fast as a danger pillow. Speaking about danger pillow, i have decided to make some quality-of-life updates to my life (for the next 2 months)

Yup, that's how my desk looks like. Today i brought my damn Ultradock to school. I'm not worried about it being stolen as i also brought this lock that, i think actually came with the Acer laptop before this one. 

Now here's some things that you won't notice immediately:
1. The SATA storage inside is missing. 
    * I have mentioned in an insta-story that that damn hard-drive, whether or not it was the one that came with the laptop, or a new HDD (which i acquired unethically), that was what made every OS run slow on my laptop. The bottleneck was the harddrive, **not the CPU nor the RAM**!!! After booting into the new Kubuntu 22.04 LTS drive, i have received the experience that I would have never expected from this laptop.
    * 
1. The external battery is missing. 
    * It's just gone, i still have it, but i really don't need it. Besides, both that and the internal battery equates to 1 hour, because..
1. The internal battery is missing. **_danger pillow_**. so i also removed it.

From the left to right, i've got:
1. The security lock. 
1. Power delivery
    * Instead of the usual 45w AC Adapter that laptop came with (or a 90w AC Adapter that i was recommended to use for the Ultradock), i used a 65W charger that connects to USB-C, max 65W, and USB-A, max 22.5w. That cable for the ThinkPad is also amazingly portable.
1. Ethernet (RJ-45)
    * School network, so somehow it's still a bit slower than my WiFi at home, but faster than the WiFi here. 
1. 2TB SSD Kubuntu Drive
    * The soul.
1. [Logitech Unifying](/unifying)
    * Kinda risky to leave it there like that, but why not.

I thought that the UltraDock had _HDMI_, turns out, it was just _DisplayPort_. Finding an adapter for it should be not problem though.

All i need now is to find the keys to this UltraDock, so that i could sleep a bit more comfortably at night. ngl, i didn't even notice the _keyhole_ until i was just leaning to my left, then i saw it, then i realized that indeed, **it does lock the laptop to itself**. My life will be complete once i get 'dem keys.

<span class="timestamp">[16:06]</span> one thing i noticed about the screen of this ThinkPad, is that, like, the seller whom i bought this from definitely replaced it, because a screen from 2015 just could not be as good as what i'm seeing now. Also, i'm getting thermal paste to replace the thermal.. substance that it came with since i bought this from 2019.

Damn, more or less this page is just me really fangirling over this laptop from 2015. Gotta appreciate the good times.

<span class="timestamp">[16:23]</span> i'm thinking of going to sim lim square after pitching a loaf, before _PM_, though i'm not sure if anyone there still knows about this product line or even have those keys.

until then, intercede for me that my mental stability stays, it was not good yesterday, but i hope to God that today and for the rest of the days come to be good.
