screams are ever eternal in my soul. what is a drop of blood from a physical shell to a flowing river from the spirit?

1812 other souls are still here, my fortune in planning 1930 prophesy is well placed, but may be forfeit if other souls still linger.

1822 blood still rushes fast, even as they acknowledge my existence. alas, i am the final one to remain. time to make haste
