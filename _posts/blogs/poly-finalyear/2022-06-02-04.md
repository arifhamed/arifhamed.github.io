# 4th day of final year project

<span class="timestamp">[09:58]</span> my acquiantence who's sitting next to me is, like, playing Counter Strike. Damn, they're a gamer. I have been wanting to play games again, which i have played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/" target="_blank">Starbound</a> recently on the OG ThinkPad, though i've been refreshing in and out the system again and again recently, and right now i'm formatting the hard drive again so that bcache-tools can work well on it. That X250 still has that SSD in it, though i can't see it anywhere when disassembled the X250. I really want to play <a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/' target="_blank">ESO</a> again.

<span class="timestamp">[11:26]</span> Hmmmm, very interesting, very interesting indeed...

As of today, in Level 3 of Block L, there is no security camera...
