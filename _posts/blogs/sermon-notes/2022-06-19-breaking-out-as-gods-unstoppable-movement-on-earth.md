is there anything on earth that's unstoppable? 
* God's love?
* God's pursuit of man??
* God's Church???

"Church" in Greek, `ekklesia`. Ekklesia is a movement of a group of people called out around the mission of God.

In Acts 1:1-14, the Bible unfolds the key ingredient to this unstoppable movement, how we as God's church would embrace 4 truths to be God's vehicle to accomplish God's mission on Earth:

01: The Promise [Joel 2:28-32], the Old Testament Promise

02: The Power [Acts 1:8a]
* "Power" in Greek: "dunamis"; Enabling source for God's purpose

03: The Plan [Acts 1:8b]

04: The Priority [Acts 1:14]
* "joined together" - " homothymadon" - "continued with one accord"
