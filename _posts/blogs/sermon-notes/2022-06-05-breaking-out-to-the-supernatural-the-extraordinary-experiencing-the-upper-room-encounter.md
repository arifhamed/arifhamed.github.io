<h1 id="sn1"><span style="font-size:60%;">Breaking out to the Supernatural, the Extraordinary, experiencing the</span> "Upper Room" Encounter</h1>

<h4 id="sn4"><span class="timestamp">Acts 1:8, Acts 1:12-14</span></h4>

A people redeemed from slavery to Satan and sin. A people set apart to live for Him. A people empowered to extend His rule on Earth by the power of the Holy Spirit. 

Jesus died, resurrected and ascended to confirm the call to the church, to continue His purpose on Earth!

After His Ascension, on the Day of Pentecost, the disciples were directe to an <span style="font-size:130%;">"Upper Room" Encounter</span> that propelled them to be powerful witnesses.

While the resurrection and the ascension of Christ cannot be repeated, as well as the day of pentecost during the early church era, the church today can and need to have this supernatural "Upper-Room" encounter to be God's powerful witnesses to fulfil Acts 1:8 ~ <span style="font-size:140%;">to go into all the world!</span>

Luke 24 and acts 1 & 2 shows you and me <span style="font-size:150%;">6 elements</span> involved in this "upper room" encounter.

1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The Promise</span> [Luke 24: 49]
    * Empowerment of the Spirit to witness
    * Expect → Pray → Happen
1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The Place</span> [Acts 1:12, 13]
    * Upper Room as God's anointed place to wait upon His Spirit
    * Set aside Time, open heart & expectant heart
1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The People</span> [Acts 1:13, 14; Acts 2:2] 
    * The Church assembled in corporate prayer
    * Church as family going in the same direction
1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The Practice</span> [Acts 1:14; Acts 2:2]
    * United & Persistent prayer 
    * To be in unity, to be persistent, to be consistent
1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The Person</span> [Acts 2:14]
    * Divine Presence of the Holy Spirit
    * The Holy Spirit is a comforter, a counsellor, a friend and is to be known intimately
    * A friend, a Powerful Presence
1. <span style="font-size:150%;">The Push Forward</span> [Acts 1:8]
    * To build and extend the church until Jesus returns
    * Going forward with the Holy Spriti Power in a single direction

<span class="disable-selection" id="truth" style="display:none;"><br><span style="font-size:120%;">Sunday</span><br> today i noticed how much i was happy stimming, and it carried on througout praise & worship, still doing a bit now, and i'm still joyful, to be in this presence of God. Towards the end of praise & worship, God spoke through Ps. Foo, that He will forgive and bring healing when I forgive. There was truly one person that I really hated: myself. I needed to forgive myself for my past self, my past self that bottled everything up, my past self that hated myself for being/not being what others thought of me. But God said He will bring healing. Thank You God, for truly giving me a sign, for reminding me that the best healing exists through You, and You alone.<br><br><span style="font-size:120%;">Cell Group</span><br>T'was a great time, instead of sharing point-to-point, we identified which of us really needed it the most, and the ones with points we'll talk about it together. The interaction was not only really fun but it also gets us to talk, its like getting a conversation. It's like a pitch instead of an essay.<br><br>i really want to have the divine presence of the Holy Spirit, because this frackin' stress, pain & mental agony that i'm facing because of how i picture my life to be, i want to allow the Holy Spirit to come into my life, to enlighten it and to push me forward, to have that affirmation that God's promises never fail. My future is still ever so foggy, it's like walking forward without my glasses, except that my physical vision is good enough to discern what is a ravine and what isn't. <br><br><br>God help me with this, Your Son sent His helper, the Holy Spirit, one of the Holy Trinity. The Holy Spirit reaches out to all, so I want to experience it as well. <br><br>oh lord, help me, this remaining 11 weeks will be pain. the holy spirit shall guide my path and light my way, to lead my little autistic soul, picking me back up whenever i trip and fall. your love is all i need. <br><br><br><br>show me life like it's supposed to be</span>
