<h4 id="sn4"><span class="timestamp"></span>Acts 3:19-21</h4>

The onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic seeks to change and defeat God's plan and purpose. However, God is preparing and ushering His Church to break into an "epoch-making" refreshing times of His new season!

Peter prophesied in Acts 3:19 for the Church to prepare for that "Kairos, Epoch Making" times of refreshing.

"Epoch-making" time:
 * Epoch: a period of time characterized by a momentous event; a fixed point from which succeeding years are numbered

The raging COVID-19 pandemic which infected 554 million and destroyed 6.36 million lives in our world is God's kairos time:
 * to do something so obvious, momentous and extraordinary
 * to usher the return of Jesus Christ "until times of Restoration of All Things" (Acts 3:21)

The apostle Peter found 3 keys all in Acts 3:19a to do something about this:

1. WE MUST REPENT
    * towards 2 things:
        1. Sin & God
        1. His Word
1. WE MUST BE CONVERTED
    * LEMME CLOSE REAL QUICK
1. WE MUST LET OUR SINS BE BLOTTED OUT
    
Blotted: removing something that is forceful, completely obliterated, completely wiped out.
