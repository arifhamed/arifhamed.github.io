Something in past, something that hurt you in past, maybe that's why you may feel useless, living life without a purpose, don't have the feeling of belonging.

The aspects of feeling useless is: 
- _feeling used_.
- _feeling used up_.
- _feeling used to_.
    - Did Philip in Philemon made himself useless? People tend to make the background people not useful. Philip the Deacon was still as useful as Philip the Apostle.

The aspects of being useful is:
- _actively using_.
    - Philip did miracles in Samaria [Acts 8:5-6]. He witnessed an Ethiopian official get saved, because Philip believed. He fathered 4 prophetesses. Someone who is not a top person broke out of that. Instead of Philip the not Pastor, he became Philip the Evangelist. He refused to be 2nd fiddle. 
    - John the Baptist said "I must decrease, so that He can increase".
    - <span style="font-size:130%;">YOU can be useful in GLORIFYING JESUS</span>
    - The person that is more awesome than an evangelist like Billy Graham, is the old grandmother who goes to pray in their closet, praying for that evangelist
    - When Jesus saw us when He was dying on the Cross, He saw us and thought it was worth it
- _actively usable_.
    - Onesimus ran away from Philemon because he thought he was useless. Paul told Onesimus to take a letter to Philemon. 
        - Fun fact: "Onesimus" is Greek for "useful".
        - Are we living like _a child of God_ ? He wants you to return, like how Onesimus returns.
    - Onesimus became useful twice (Paul & Philemon).
    - Barnabbas brought Mark to the group's second mission even if Peter thought he was useless because Mark left the first mission
        - Fun fact: "Barnabbas" means "son of encouragement"
        - <span style="font-size:130%;">Let there be a lot of encouragement in this church</span>
    - A testimony about how a twice rape victim became a minister who received a million dollars from Amazon to provide for the homeless by the coasts of Hawaii (pls find link)
