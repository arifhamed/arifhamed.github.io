1. It is God's will to heal, <span style="font-size:150%;">always</span>
    - He does not delay in you being not healed, because He is a Healer
    - When Jesus died on the cross, there was 2 things:
        - He saves because He is the Saviour (it is His total nature, a noun)
        - When we take communion (by His stripes, we are healed). 39 known diseases, 39 lashes on the back. The atonement represents Him being the <span style="font-size:150%;">Saviour</span> & the <span style="font-size:150%;">Healer</span>
    - The communion, when taken in the right posture that is willing to see Him heal, <span style="font-size:150%;">it can heal you</span>.
1. Healing takes <span style="font-size:150%;">robus faith</span> [Matthew 17:18-20]
    - 3 disciples witnessed the transfiguration, whereas the other 9 attempt to exorcist a father's demon-possessed child.
    - The story of Heidi Baker in Mozambique, and her robust faith that healed many blind & deaf (google it)
1. Healing may require <span style="font-size:150%;">more than one prayer</span> 
    - Mark 8:22-25
1. Healing may be gradual
    - 2 Kings 20:5-7
        - These verses, it shows a man of God using both God's power and medicine to heal
    - No matter each day's battles, when you continue to seek the healing, you will have more days that are of healing, than if you are not to seek healing, which would lead to daily death & despair 
1. Healing may need an impartation
    - Laying on of hands [2 Timothy 1:6]
    - Power of Proximity [Numbers 11:16-17]
        - "..the anointing will go from you to them.."
