"The Holy Spirit's main ministry is not to give thrills but to create in us Christ-like character" - J. I. Packer


Here is a checklist to ask our ourselves:
1. Are you more thirsty for God than ever before?
1. Are you more loving?
1. Are you more sensitive to and aware of God than ever before?
1. Are you governed more and more by God's Word?
1. Are you concerned more and more with the physical and spiritual needs if others?
1. Are you more and more concerned with the church and the kingdom of God?
1. Are the disciplines of the Christian life more and more important to you?
1. Are you more and more aware of your sin?
1. Are you more and more willing to forgive others?
1. Are you thinking more and more of Heaven and of being with the Lord Jesus?

<span style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">3 problems in Saul's life:</span>

* Problem _#1_: **HE DIDN'T FEAR GOD** [1 Samuel 13:8-14, 1 Samuel 15:17-23]
* Problem _#2_: **HE DIDN'T TREASURE THE PRESENCE OF GOD** [1 Samuel 14:18-19, 35]
    * break out from prayerlessness
    * we need to overcome the laziness, the prayerlessness, the procrastination, all that. let's take time to engage in prayer
* Problem _#3_: **HE DIDN'T DEAL WITH THE "HEART" ISSUES** [1 Samuel 18:7-9]
    * Saul had _insecurity_ (ref. scripture) 
    * small comparisons, when _left unsettled_, could sow the seed of jealousy
        * which was why Saul received an evil spirit, and also _sought out to kill David_
    * Saul's **pride**, **fear** & **jealousy** caused his life to **go downhill**
    * We need to dare to confront the "heart" issues when God brings it up
        * **God reveals it for our good**

<span style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">Conclusion</span>

The Early Church **feared God**, **treasured the presence of God**, **dealt with the "heart" issues**, **and <span style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;">impacted + made an impact!!</span>**

Build our inner life, **don't just look good on the outside!!**
