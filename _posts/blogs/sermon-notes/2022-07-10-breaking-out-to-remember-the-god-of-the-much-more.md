<h4 id="sn4"><span class="timestamp"></span>Deuteronomy 2:1-8</h4>

The Book of Deuteronomy is a Book of <span style='font-size: 140%;'>Remembrance</span>

In _Deuteronomy 8_ delineates for the new generation of Israelites entering into the Promised Land and for us, <span style="font-size:130%;">3 important things</span>, _we must rememember_, if we are to experience the new season of the much more of God (after the 40 years of wilderness wandering):

1. We must discern our heart
    * _Know what we are inside_
    * Deuteronomy 8:2
    * "_Discern_" because of our tendency:
        * To be camouflaged by our personality
        * To camouflage with our religiosity
        * to be camouflaged by our giftedness
    * God sees The Heart
        * Jeremiah 17:9-10
2. We must prioritise God's Word
    * _Above and beyond our capabilities_
    * Deuteronomy 8:3
    * God fed them with manna
        * Fun fact: Hebrew meaning of manna:
            * _"What is this"_
        * "God meeting our needs in His way will fill us"
    * Exercising our Faith is more important than relying on our natural resources
3. We must move in the power of God
    * _not lean on our own workings_
    * Deuteronomy 8:18
