<h1 id="sn1"><span style="font-size:60%;">Break out to walk in God's</span> Divine Call</h1>

<h4 id="sn4"><span class="timestamp">Ezekiel 1:1-10</span></h4>

The world is calling out loudly to everyone and telling us what is important and what we must paritcipate in to follow and do:
- through the social system (ref. mark zuckerberg)
- through the education system (ref. nelson mandela)

God is also awakening his people today:
- to His Call
- to His Cause
- to His Priority

While the nation of Israel was in captivity, God called Ezekiel (in Ezekiel 1:1-3) and awakened him with **_2 VISIONS_** so that he can break out to walk in God's divine call:

1. A being of 4 faces, that symbolizes:
    1. A man: the intelligence understanding aspect of God
    1. An ox: the servanthood and sacrifice of God
    1. A lion: the sovereignty and supremacy of God
    1. An eagle: the power and deity/divinity of God
1. A wheel (many wheels and eyes within) that is moving in all directions, symbolizing:
    1. God is present everywhere 
    1. God is able to see all things 

Ezekiel was overwhelmed by the glory and the holiness of God (Ezekiel 1.28) resulting in worship.
* Exalting God (His sovereignty, His character, His power)
* Humbling us (God speaks when we are humbled)

What did God say to Ezekiel

1. God told Ezekiel to Stand Up
    * Ezekiel 2:1 
        * _And He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you."_
    * Stand up, be fully alert, pay full attention.
    * What is God saying to us individually, corporately?
1. God told Ezekiel to Listen Up
    * Ezekiel 2:2 
        * _Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me._
    * Listen up, be listening, inclining ear and seeing eye
    * 1 Samuel 3:9,10 
        * _"Speak, Lord, for your servant hears"_

1. God told Ezekiel to Go Up
    * Ezekiel 2:3
        * _And He said to me: "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day_
    * Go up, "actions" that will bring change, that will be divine, motivated by Him

1. God told Ezekiel to Speak Up
    * Ezekiel 2:4
        * _For they are impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, "Thus says the Lord God"_
    * Speak up, communicate God's message, nor merely 'feel good' message, but also 'foundational' message

1. God told Ezekiel to Open Up
    * Ezekiel 2:8
        * _"But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open yout mouth, and eat what I give you."_
    * Open up, "Eat God's Word", Apply the Gospel to your life. YOUR LIFE.

Conclusion:

God is awakening his divine call in all of us. Don't allow the world to determine how we live, how we think, and what we ought to do. If we don't walk in our calling as _God's_ people, we will fulfill the _world's_ calling. 

what about you today? will you **break out**, be awakened to **God's divine call**?
