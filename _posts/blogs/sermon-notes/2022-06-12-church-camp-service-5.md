There are VIPs (Very Important Person) in your life, people who are important to you, people that you respect and maybe love.

Then there are VDPs (Very Difficult Person) in your life. You know a few. 

After being spat out of the Fish of God, Jonah witnessed the saving of an entire nation. It was the biggest revival and salvation rate in the Bible. In all of this, Jonah was.. _"exceedingly angry"_ [Jonah 4:1]

Jonah sat down, and complained and grumbled. Then a plant appeared and he was like "aight that's pretty cool".

Then it was gone, and Jonah complained again. <span style="font-size:120%;">then the Lord said "You had compassion over the plant that lived for a day, yet had no compassion of the Ninevites?"</span> [Jonah 4:10-11]
