> _"Imagine a place where all that is lost and forgotten goes; old toys, letters, socks. The Forgotten Lands is a magical world inhabited by Forgotlings; living mislaid objects longing to be remembered." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hitcents.forgottonanne" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Forgotton Anne is a seamless cinematic adventure with meaningful storytelling and light puzzle platforming. You are Anne, the enforcer who keeps order in the Forgotten Lands, as she sets out to squash a rebellion that might prevent her master, Bonku, and herself from returning to the human world...

<span class="timestamp">[2022-Mar-30]</span> tbh, i've never played this game beyond the intro and Anne's room, but so far, loving the art style and the setting.

The following XAPK file is of a demo, it states so in the Play Store.

<div class="text-center">
    <a class="btn btn-dark btn-block w-100" onclick='apk("com.hitcents.forgottonanne_1.4.xapk")' target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; background-color: #333;"> Download <b>com.hitcents.forgottonanne_1.4.xapk</b> (1.1 GB)</a>
</div>

<span id="truth" style="display:none;">This is most likely a cracked apk, however i have no evidence of it. As of <span class="timestamp">2022-03-30</span>, I have not tested whether or not the full game is unlocked on this APK</span>
