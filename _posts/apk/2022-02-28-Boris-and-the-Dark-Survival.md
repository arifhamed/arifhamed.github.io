> _"Play as Boris the Wolf, the cartoon companion of Bendy, as you hunt throughout the abandoned cartoon studio for the supplies Boris needs to keep going. Youâ€™re not alone! The monstrous Ink Demon stalks you at every turn. Beware the sound of his beating heart as he creeps up from behind and catches you in his dripping gaze. No where is safe. Yet secrets lie in wait for those adventurous enough to seek them out." - <a href="https://joeydrewstudios.com/batds" target="_blank">Joey Drew's Official Website</a>_

I only found out about this game not so long ago, when I was web crawling for clean APKs. I never knew that the developers behind Bendy & the Ink Machine were this proactive in creating games, and it is beyond just [porting an existing game to Android](https://arifhamed.github.io/resources/apk/Bendy-and-the-Ink-Machine). 

This is a game where you basically survive. Somehow, I was intrigued at how players in Steam decided to give this game the `casual` tag, so it appears that this game won't be all the horror all the time, so it uses Bendy as a factor of survival, or at least, a factor of non-survival. If you really like the Bendy franchise, you should really try out this game!

Note that <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d9bf4a4d49c42466338a6a5e07ba0e71ebb5d361f7d131329d1a4924f6c8eef8/details" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a> gave this a false-positive (_Android.PUA.DebugKey_), as it is cracked.
