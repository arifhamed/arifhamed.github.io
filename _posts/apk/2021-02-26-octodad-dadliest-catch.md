> _"Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.younghorses.octodad" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Octodad was a game that was quite popular when it was greenlit by some YouTubers, and it reminded me a bit of some other games like Hand Simulator... <!--more-->Though when i played it for the first time with the APK, I was super impressed and really had a lot fun controlling Octodad around. This, along with Human Fall Flat, is a genre that I like a lot, the whole physics thing.

Note that <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab4582ce6f6aceffc1ceeb3276d2274167f6ac13420a9599f6e823aac5692296/details" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a> gave this a false-positive (_Android.PUA.DebugKey_), which means it is cracked.
