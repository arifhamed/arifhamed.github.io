<span class="timestamp">07 May 2022:</span> Hmmmmm, interesting stuff. This is kinda like a capture-the-flag game, where the flags are just the asteroid stations around or something. Honestly, not much in this game for me to comment. There's clearly a good amount of effort in this game though. It's good, just a bit underwhelming, in my opinion.
