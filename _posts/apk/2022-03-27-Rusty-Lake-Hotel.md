> _"Welcome our guests to the Rusty Lake Hotel and make sure they will have a pleasant stay. There will be 5 dinners this week. Make sure every dinner is worth dying for." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.RustyLakeHotel" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

One thing that caught my attention about this game is its art style, and then the mystery after playing it. Before this game, i played through all the Cube Escape games by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5341269538359321555" target="_blank">Rusty Lake</a>, or at least before <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection" target="_blank">Cube Escape Collection</a>, haven't played that one yet. I personally really like this escape room point-and-click game.
