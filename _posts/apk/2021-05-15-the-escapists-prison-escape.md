<span class="timestamp">22 April 2022:</span> This is yet another oldie but goldie. This game, and along with the [next instalment](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/The-Escapists-2-Pocket-Breakout), absolutely exploded throughout youtube when it was released/popularized. 

You're in prison, but you want to escape. Basically, know how to escape. Strategize, know when to use your energy, know when to be bold, outsmart the authorities, and <span style="font-size:130%;text-shadow:10px 10px 0, -10px -10px 0;">escape</span>. i'm pretty sure the next game is the same thing.
