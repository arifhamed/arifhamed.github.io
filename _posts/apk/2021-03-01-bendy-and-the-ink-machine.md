> _"Play as Henry as he revisits the demons of his past by exploring the abandoned animator's workshop of Joey Drew Studios. With twists and turns at every corner, you never know who or what is waiting for you in this dilapidated world of shadows and ink. Solve the riddle. Escape the workshop. Above all, fear the machine and survive." - <a href="https://joeydrewstudios.com/batim" target="_blank">Joey Drew's Official Website</a>_

Ahh, this would be referred to as a classic after many years, because somehow, it already has the classic vibe from it! This game takes a unique spin on the horror genre while also bringing up an old conspiracy related to Walt Disney and his competitors. 

I believe this game is popular enough so that I don't have to re-explain this game, and just like [Boris & the Dark Survival](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Boris-and-the-Dark-Survival), this was a port to Android (and iOS) that was executed well.
