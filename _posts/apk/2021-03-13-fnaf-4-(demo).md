> _"You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottgames.fnaf4" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Now this game, like, this is still following the formula of survival horror but it takes a whole new way of execution, and this game is one of the most cleanest execution i've ever seen. 

You have to read the lore to really understand for yourself. This time, the horror is kinda a bit more convincing because it's all hallucinations now (i think)

The following file is a demo uploaded by <a href="https://five-nights-at-freddys-4-demo.en.uptodown.com/android" target="_blank">UpToDown</a>, backed up by me.
