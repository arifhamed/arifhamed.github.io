> _A girl called Viola wakes up in the forest.<br>She follows the path to the inner area of the forest.<br>Deep in the wood, she finds "The Witch's House"...<br> - <a href="https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/13632" target="_blank">QooApp English</a>_

<span class="timestamp">25 April 2022:</span> This game was the pinnacle of horror RPG Maker games, where it was popularized by _Mark Edward Fischbach_ in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hIZNaBH0lw" target="_blank">June 2013</a>. Jam-packed with scariness, jumpscares, and a good plot, it stood out to many people. One thing that made this game work well (just like most other games), is the OST.

This game is actually present on Google Play, but the reviews on it really shows it out a lot. Somehow, I was able to get this from QooApp, and unfortunately there is no English translation.
