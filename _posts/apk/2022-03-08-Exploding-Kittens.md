Not much to say about this game, besides the fact that i regret recording the first time i booted up the game, got my first win. The card game in real life was quite fun, this game i up there with super unique card game concepts that also has great execution, like Coup, Stable Unicorns, Sabotuer, just to state a few, you know.
