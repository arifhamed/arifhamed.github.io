> _"Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza! <br><br>In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike! <br><br>What could go wrong?" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottgames.fnaf2" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

This game is basically the last game but different views, more animatronics, new concepts like marionette's music box. 

The best thing about this game is Withered Bonnie, like, he's not all out the kill you, rather he's just criticizing you for whatever you have done. Listening to his lines in this game is golden.

``` console
"Time to face the consequences of your failure."

"Might as well face the facts. You're always destined to fail."

"You blinked."

"What is this new prison; is it me trapped, or is it you? Perhaps, is us both."

"I may be missing my face, but even I could see you stalk."
```

look at this dude
