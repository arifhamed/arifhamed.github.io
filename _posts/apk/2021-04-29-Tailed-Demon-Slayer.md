<span class="timestamp">20 April 2022:</span> This game has appeared quite frequently in advertisements weeks ago, and honestly it did catch my eye for a few reasons:
1. There is the basic satisfying action that comes with an action game
1. It is vertical
1. It can be played AFK, basically creating the illusion of multi-tasking. 
1. MOUSE

and yeah it's an example of a good timekiller mobile game.
