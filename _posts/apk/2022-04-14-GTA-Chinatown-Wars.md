> _"Following his father's murder, Huang Lee has a simple mission: deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. After being robbed and left to die, he will search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstargames.gtactw" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Yo this game's pretty fun. I've heard from multiple people on the internet that this was one of the best games GTA games that they played, and yeah, playing it on DS originally really left a good impression on me, and just as good on Android.

Nothing much else to say about this game, for its a GTA game.
