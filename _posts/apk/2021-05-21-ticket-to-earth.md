> _"A distant planet. A dying colony. A deadly conspiracy. Fight a corrupt system in Ticket to Earth, the revolutionary tactical puzzle RPG!" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robot_circus.TTE" target="_blank"></a>_

<span class="timestamp">02 May 2022:</span> Initially, I thought this was a visual novel because of the artstyle, though it may as well still be because of the cutscenes. This is one of those dystopian type games, and this is the setting where people are fighting for resources or a specific resource. That resource is indeed the titular "Ticket to Earth". Apparently no one's on Earth. All in all, it looks like a well chiseled game with a good design direction, both aesthetically and gameplay.
