I actually bought this a long while ago, using those voucher-type cards that you can buy from convenience stores. 

Not only was this a long game but i also love it. You can basically create almost everything (except poop) and even add adjectives to them (except poop). Your chicken-headed character is basically God, and i won't be surprised if you can summon that as well.
