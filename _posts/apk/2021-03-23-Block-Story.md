> _"There isn’t much better than a wide open game world in which you have essentially no limits and can alter the very landscape in which you play – that is, unless you add dragons, of course…" - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270110/Block_Story/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

If you can describe a childhood game that is also a Minecraft clone, this is one of them. I remember actually really liking this game, especially in the earlier version where TNT arrows would destroy water blocks and it would leave potholes of water near my house. Honestly, the description i got from staem above really reflects this game.

Ironically, the thing that turned me off after a while of playing this game is its graphics. Its so jarring to see high-def npc models next to low-res blocks and items. Also, the redstone in bedrock and java mc is just better compared to whatever this one has.

Although, it has some points that make it stand out, such as dragons, different dragons, many different npcs, hell, aether, goblins, mjolnir swords, elevators, jetpacks, a goddamn wooden car, your own pet dragon, and quite a lot more!

Here is the demo Block Story, which is somewhat.. minimal. Many features are cut off, as compared to the full version.
