> _"Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottgames.fivenightsatfreddys" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

To be frank, I am not scared of robots or animatronics, no matter how much you make it scary. In where I live, animatronics never became a thing, and also, i love robots, both in hardware and software. That means that, no matter how much you put in the fact that Freddy and his friends are possessed or whatever, I still see them as robots that do not comply with the robot laws or whatever, and just some amateur AI inside.

To really want to understand this game (and the rest of the games), either just play it or watch markiplier or something.
