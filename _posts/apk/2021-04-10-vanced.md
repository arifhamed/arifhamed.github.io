As of <span class="timestamp">12 March 2022</span>, Vanced has been discontinued and has disabled their download links in their website. Any existing app or copy of Youtube Vanced or Youtube Music Vanced may continue to function for about 2 years. 

From <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-mod-root-nonroot-vanced.3758757/" target='_blank'>XDA</a>, here is a description of Vanced:

> Vanced is a well-known modded version of the YouTube app with many features such as ad-blocking and background playback. Vanced also offers some extra features to enhance the user experience. The entire list is available below:<br><br>

<span style="font-size:160%;">For every head chopped off, the Hydra would regrow two heads</span>. Not only are there many alternatives like Vanced, but there are some people who have backed up the Vanced server so that Vanced will keep on going, most likely under a different name soon.

I'm not sure if this apk works but i still decide to upload it for the sake of it.
