> _"Investigate murders, search for clues and talk to your classmates to prepare for trial. There, you'll engage in deadly wordplay, going back and forth with suspects. Dissect their statements and fire their words back at them to expose their lies! There's only one way to surviveâ€”pull the trigger." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413410/Danganronpa_Trigger_Happy_Havoc/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. The first game, and in my opinion<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup> the best, of the Danganronpa franchise.

i. love. this. game! and the whole franchise too. So many interesting characters, some which i favour over others, some not really. The thing about the first game is that I don't hate any of the characters in this one!

For a more in-depth explanation, just watch, like, game grumps or something. I've been watching them quite a lot, and when they started the first Danganronpa playthrough, I immediately understand why there was an uproar of fandom for Danganronpa when it was released. Pretty cool game, 11/10.
