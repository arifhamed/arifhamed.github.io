> _"A new cast of 16 characters find themselves kidnapped and imprisoned in a school. Inside, some will kill, some will die, and some will be punished. Reimagine what you thought high-stakes, fast-paced investigation was as you investigate twisted murder cases and condemn your new friends to death" - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567640/Danganronpa_V3_Killing_Harmony/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">26 April 2022:</span> Now you might be wondering, why is this post written much more earlier than the other ones before this since [The Witch's House](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/The-Witch's-House)? Well, that's because my excitement is beyond measure to share with you this APK that I MYSELF HAVE FABRICATED, OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF DARKNESS (the internet) AND INTO THE FORGE OF SOLUS (some [useful tools](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/tools) that i used). I have myself THE QUINTESSENTIAL APK (as of recorded timestamp at the start of this passage, also as of version 1.0.2), and I really want to see this get distributed around the internet.

The greatest downside to this, however, is the fact that the majority of the storage goes as data, not obb, which means that it is harder of other professional APK hackers to combine the full game. The 'initial' game gets downloaded first. Perhaps in the future, we would end up with something like Danganronpa [1](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Danganronpa-Trigger-Happy-Havoc) & [2](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Danganronpa-2-Goodbye-Despair), where the obb is huge, more than 2 GB. In the end DRV3 without connection would be possible, one day.

Other than that, this is a great day to find out that someone took the opportunity to pirate this game weeks after it got released. 

<span class="timestamp">27 April 2022:</span> lmaooo apkaward.com, amongst other vendors, already found out the way to create a singular apk like mine. Mine's better though, because apkaward put in that "APKAWARD.COM" toast that no one likes. Also, apkaward's copy of DRV3 is <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4cc375108d8d67d56492b77b5c66edfd8920b6d1d80d8ba7293724bebd09e0cf" target="_blank">littered with adware</a>, like jeez, it's like if vegas was in file. That's right, i threw some shade right there. 

<div class="text-center">

</div>
Data will download itself. Perhaps i may update here with the data, but it's large.
