> _"Kingdom: New Lands builds upon the award-winning gameplay and mystery of Kingdom by introducing an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to experience and enjoy." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/496300/Kingdom_New_Lands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">22 April 2022:</span> This is another one of those games that was revealed on youtube. Saw draegast play this and realised that it's pretty neat.

You have a crown, don't drop it. Use gold to build your kingdom and get it people to work for you. Also, you basically ride on your horse the entire time, so one has to wonder if you are actually a centaur.
