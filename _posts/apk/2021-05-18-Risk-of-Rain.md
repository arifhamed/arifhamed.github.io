> _"Risk of Rain is an action platformer with roguelike elements. With permanent death as a primary feature, players will have to play their best to get as far as possible. Fight on a mysterious planet with randomly spawning enemies and bosses, either alone or with 3 friends in online co-op." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">29 April 2022:</span> The package name of the apk here is kinda weird, as it lead me to <a href="https://mrpowergamerbr.com/" target="_blank">MrPowerGamerBR's website</a>, and they apparently made Undertale on mobile too. I may consider looking at it at some point. Also, even though this game does not commercially exist, Risk of Rain on PC is not free, so um, i'm just gonna mark this one as piracy (just like [Thomas was Alone](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Thomas-Was-Alone))

Either way, Risk of Rain is a roguelite, where you're basically someone on a ship that crashlanded on a planet and now you gotta fight your way somewhere. Not even survive, just blast through everything and everyone. This game caught my attention because of the charming pixelated graphics, and then it charmed me again for its pretty enticing gameplay. 10/10 fun game, btw the numbers i have here like 9/10 or 3/10 really doesn't matter, it's just comedy, because this website's a joke.
