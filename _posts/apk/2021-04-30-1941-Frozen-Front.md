<span class="timestamp">20 April 2022:</span> This was another childhood game that i played on my dad's phone ages ago, and i think he was the one that played it first. 

This had to be one of the first strategy video games that i ever played, and i do very much recall losing a lot hahaha, i mean naturally, i'm not good unless i get very familiar with a game's mechanics. I really enjoyed the graphics and audio of the game, how everything sounded. 

Plus, it's also free.
