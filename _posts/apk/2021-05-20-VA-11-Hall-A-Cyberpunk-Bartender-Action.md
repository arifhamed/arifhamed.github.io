> _"VA-11 HALL-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action is a booze em' up about waifus, technology, and post-dystopia life." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">01 May 2022:</span> This game is a very different game that really sets itself apart from other visual novels! Imagine, like, that bartender game from Y8 before the flash player exile, and also in a visual novel that is also cyberpunk. Besides that, I have not much more to describe it.
