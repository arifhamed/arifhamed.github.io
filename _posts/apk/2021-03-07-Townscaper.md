This is one of those games that i thought i would never play but playing it for a few minutes turned to a few hours. It is simply a relaxing game, a game that's zen. No need to care about finances, no such thing as timers, and it even has saves that you can just copy and paste. 

<!-- I love it, it somewhat alleviates my asd symptoms. -->
