> _"Build and manage a medieval graveyard while facing ethical dilemmas and making questionable decisions. Welcome to Graveyard Keeper, the most inaccurate medieval cemetery sim of the year." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599140/Graveyard_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">22 April 2022:</span> The graphics and ip makes this game stands out, but the reviews mentioned how the game is outdated garbage, which after playing for a while, i can kinda see that. However, i'm not just gonna shit all over a game on this website, so here it is.

looks like stardew valley but more dead people, and about less foraging, i think.
