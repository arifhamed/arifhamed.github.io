What an interesting game. It is so interesting, in fact, that there is almost no presence of this original anywhere on the internet, except mentiones of a remake and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infinitydevs.deepspaceprem" target="_blank">a different game</a> but almost same name and same concept.

Just like [Thomas was Alone](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Thomas-Was-Alone), it used to exist on the Play Store, but Play Store was like "nah". <a href="https://www.playstoresales.com/app/dead-space/" target="_blank">PlayStoreSales</a> still has a record of it, though.
