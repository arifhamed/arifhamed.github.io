I like this game. Released not too long ago, you're character escapes city life for a life of adventure and building, kinda like Stardew Valley but more building than farming. <!--more-->So far, I have played up until I had to build a bridge, and I still can't get over how big and extensive this game is. There is so much that I can't even describe it, and it is also a good game too.

This is a **huge** game, the APK itself is **1.13 GB**, making it the biggest file so far. This a port(ia, lol geddit?) of its PC counterpart, and looking at the genres below, it sure has a _hard time_ on _lower spec phones_, though it works just barely above acceptable for my phone running on a PowerVR GPU (highly doubt Mali would run above 10 fps)

LATEST UPDATE: I have decided to upload the common APKS file instead, as not only was it significantly easier for me to scan it with VirusTotal, but the XAPK installer can also install APKS apparently.
