> _"TaffyTales is a fun narrative game that perfectly combines the gameplay of classic interactive fiction games, graphic adventures, and dating simulators, to create a game experience reminiscent of titles such as 'Leisure Suit Larry' or 'Doki Doki Literature Club'." - <a href="https://taffytales.en.uptodown.com/android" target="_blank">UpToDown</a>_

i have not played this game at all, and uh..  i also do not know why i downloaded this. As i searched this game online for details to write this down, i realised that i don't see any paywalls of this game.
