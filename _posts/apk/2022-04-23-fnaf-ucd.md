<span class="timestamp">20 April 2022:</span> When i was getting FNAF 1 to 6, i brushed over this one because i thought it was fanmade. Little did i know that it is actually quite connected to the main lore. It was after watching Wendigoon's summary on the FNAF series, where i decided to get this game in particular.

The only thing that grinds my gears is that the steam version of this game is free.
