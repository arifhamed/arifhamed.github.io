> _"At the beginning of the game you are a pilot of a small ship. Financial struggle forces you to start transporting contraband. Certainly, it will lead to you being in trouble with the law someday. But at some point in your life you are forced to make a deal with the authorities of the system. And that is when your dangerous space adventure begins." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skvgames.GalaxyGenome" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

<span class="timestamp">[2022-Apr-20]</span> This game, like, somehow, reminds me of both FTL **&** Endless Sky. As of the time of this entry, i have not recorded the gameplay, which also means when testing the file i have not played it much besides the basic functions of the game.
