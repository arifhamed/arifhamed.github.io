> _"Your avatar is a brave warrior who has fallen in battle. But instead of well-deserved peace in Asgard, his soul is trapped in the harsh world of Niffelheim. Survive in this hostile world, ransack the neighbor lands, explore dangerous dungeons and find your way to Valhalla" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elladagames.niffelheim" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Niffelheim was an interesting game, it has the feeling and controls of Dead Cells, the survival aspect of Terraria. How the gathering of resources really reminded me of My Time at Portia. I only played for like 30min, but it seems pretty well made. Graphics are nice, controls are good, performance is alright, or at least with my average phone.

I do not guarantee that it would 100% work.
