> _"In a bizarre universe where the oppressed are on the brink of oblivion, Dandara has awoken to reshape the world." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612390/Dandara_Trials_of_Fear_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

Now I don't have much to say about this game, but I can confidently say that this is a unique concept that is executed well. To be frank, the storyline wasn't super clear to me, but its alright. 

In this game, you have two things you can do (or at least on how far I have played the game), you can jump to specific marked places in the world, and also shoot some shotgun that you were born with. The gameplay above should be sufficient.
