> _"You start out on the surface on a mine shaft, faced with several deposits of valuable ores. You begin building your basic mining rig, harvesting the resources and transporting them via conveyor belts to your storage center. You gather more resources, invest into research & development, discover new techniques and machinery. Your factory grows, your processing chains grow longer, you need to expand." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dakror.quarry" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Drill Down is basically something like Mindustry, or Factor.io. It works, not much to say right now, I enjoyed classic Mindustry imo, Drill Down was probably inspired from it. <!--more-->I don't intend to play further than the above gameplay though, until I have that itch. Although, to be honest, I would rather be playing Mindustry instead, its a 100% free alternative to this or even Factor.io. <span style="font-size:70%">If I have my files right, this one is the paid version</span>
