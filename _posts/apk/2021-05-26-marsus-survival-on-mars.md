<span class="timestamp">07 May 2022:</span> I wanted this game a while back because it looked high-def, and I was shocked to see it function pretty well on my own phone, as it was so high-def. It looks a like swell game if I continued to play it, it looks pretty well done, besides the microsoft paint inventory & crafting UI.
