> _"Vector is an exciting, arcade-style game featuring you as the exceptional free runner who wonâ€™t be held down by the system. In this totalitarian world freedom and individually is nothing more than a distant dream. But the heart of a freerunner is strong, and so you break free." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/248970/Vector/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

<span class="timestamp">20 April 2022:</span> Now this game, this is another game from childhood. This was the game that thought me timing. This isn't a rhythm game though it isn't that far from one. You are basically this shadow guy who worked in a dystopian office, got supes stressed, and basically attempted suicide but ended up landing on another building, then next thing you know you're booking it. Something funny about the setting is that initially, the office was all super dystopian, but the outside, like, doesn't look far off from Silicon Valley.
