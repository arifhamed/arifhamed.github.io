> _"Battlevoid: Harbinger is a hard sci-fi space exploration game blending roguelike, turn-based, star map strategy, and real-time space battles. You are a young commander given the task to venture out into enemy territories, far away from home to unknown galaxies, never knowing what you will face as you jump out from hyperspace." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.bugbyte.harbinger" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

<span class="timestamp">07 May 2022:</span> Ok, I am sure there differences between this and [Sector Siege](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Battlevoid-Sector-Siege), and i'm not sure what it is. The aesthetic is almost the same though, and the tutorial guy is the same person, so at least both games have continuity unlike Space Quest 1-5 and from 6.
