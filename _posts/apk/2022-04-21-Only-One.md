> _"Defeat your enemies in gruelling combat or take the easy way out and push them off the pillar to their death down below. Capture enemy shields to block your opponents attacks and use your abilities in strategic and dynamic ways like deflecting fireballs back at the wizard or going in dangerously close and unleashing the whirlwind." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rebelbinary.onlyone" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

<span class="timestamp">20 April 2022:</span> I remember, like, farming on this game on my dad's phone all day when i was just a kid. A pixelated hack-n-slash, you must be the Only One left standing, on whatever demonic pillar you are standing on. It has pretty cool combat mechanics, a lot of skills you can use, actively & passively. The only downside is that a lot of the skills are behind a paywall. I guess that's why it's free.
