> _"Turmoil is a casual business simulation game inspired by the oil rush in 19th-century North America. It is developed by Dutch game studio Gamious and published by LTGames. In Turmoil, you are up against time and rivals on your path to becoming a succesful oil entrepreneur. Start raking in the oil money and watch the town grow along with you!" - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ltgames.android.oil" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Alrightio, this is a resource-management game where you're an aspiring oil tycoon in the old west (or maybe kinda possess one, you get to choose between 4 characters, the other 3 become your competitors in the oil race. In each drilling period, you have to strategize and make the most out of your plot of land, oh and also, don't get bankrupt.

If you wanna know more, just watch, like, Draegast or Mattshea or something. You can also just go to Play Store, its free.
