&lt;couldn't find a suitable description&gt;

This was quite a good game iirc back in primary school. It was quite fun, commandeering a ship across the galaxy, doing missions and going through a story i think. To be frank, I do not remember what the story is about, but i do remember about aliens and powerful ships, and some cool names from the planets, though the only one i can remember is Kaneheim.

This game is basically Endless Sky on mobile, and not at all like FTL. Either way, i remember having a blast with this game. Though imo, could use more music, as even so the title screen music is awesome. (note for arif: find and save that audio file, look at the apk).

One thing interesting about the APK is that when unpacked, most of the assets are code-named with just alphabets, and there is definitely some sort of APK sorcery with this APK.
