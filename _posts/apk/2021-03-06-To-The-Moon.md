> _"Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning… but only in their patients’ heads. <br><br>Due to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t. <br><br>This particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny’s past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is. <br><br>And Johnny’s last wish is, of course… to go to the moon." - <a href="https://freebirdgames.com/games/to-the-moon/" target="_blank">Freebird Games</a>_

To The Moon. This was one of those games where tears fell. This is an example of good story-telling, especially within the setting that comes with the story.

I would rather you find out about the game yourself. This game won multiple awards, and it deserves it. I played this game on my phone of all places, and I kept on playing until it finishes, because it was that good. Freebird games really nailed it with their story, direction, music, everything. I would very much recommend their other games like <a href="https://freebirdgames.com/games/a-bird-story/" target="_blank">Bird Story</a> & <a href="https://freebirdgames.com/games/finding-paradise/" target="_blank">Finding Paradise</a>. As of <span class="timestamp">2022-03-20</span>, I have not played <a href="https://freebirdgames.com/games/impostor-factory/" target="_blank">Impostor Factory</a>, but from the trailers, it looks pretty rad ngl

Also, please listen to `Everything's Alright` by Laura Shigihara once your played through the game, i absolutely love it. As I was editing this i got distracted for a while while listening to the song. I really want to do a cover of it, maybe a translated cover of it too.
