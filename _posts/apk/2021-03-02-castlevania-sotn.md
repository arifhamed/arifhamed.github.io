This is a Castlevania game. It is literally a genre. I don't have much to say, besides playing the first few moments that I realized this was where a legendary meme was birthed.

Note that <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/210124cd4dc1d802ed5b99647d9dce6707ff4709ecb0d024dc11c5259c68845b" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a> gave the inner APK a false positive (_A.gray.Nebula.a_).
