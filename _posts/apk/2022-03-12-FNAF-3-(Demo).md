> _"Thirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed its doors, the events that took place there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of "Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction" are determined to revive the legend and make the experience as authentic as possible for patrons, going to great lengths to find anything that might have survived decades of neglect and ruin. <br><br>At first there were only empty shells, a hand, a hook, an old paper-plate doll, but then a remarkable discovery was made... <br><br>The attraction now has one animatronic." - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottgames.fnaf3" target="_blank">Play Store</a>_

Now the one thing I absolutely love about this game, is Springtrap. It's probably my favourite animatronic design so far, because not only are they the only antagonist in this game, but also, simply of how they look.

The apparent lore is that <span onclick="document.getElementById('spoilers').style.display = inline;">&lt;spoilers&gt;</span> <span id="spoilers" style="display:none;">someone's inside the springtrap suit but whatever, looking at how bloody and rusty the inside is, they probably weak as hell.</span>

I like the twist from pizzeria to haunt-theme musuem tho
