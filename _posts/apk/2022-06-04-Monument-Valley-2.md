<span class="timestamp">08 May 2022:</span> I have not played this game much, but for all I know, it holds out as much as it predecessor, [Monument Valley](https://arifhamed.com/resources/apk/Monument-Valley). Plus, they support trees which is pretty nice! Not a lot of game publishers or developers would go out their way to use their game to promote world peace or combating global warming.
