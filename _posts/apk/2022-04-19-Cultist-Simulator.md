> _"Seize forbidden treasures. Summon alien gods. Feed on your disciples. Cultist Simulator is a game of apocalypse and yearning. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories." - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator/" target="_blank">Steam</a>_

I feel like, there is a small chance, a very small chance, that this game may have unintentionally and indirectly influenced some people to join actual cults or create one. I played this game a bit and i found that that the first of the details became way too relatable. As of this typing, i'm currently in an internship, then going back to school after it, so i'm not a neet, but still. 

I can see how people in that position can easily get into a cult. Watching a lot of Wendigoon really gets into the details about this kind of stuff.

Other than that, i really love the graphics of this game. Very smooth animations, sharp textures, also the intuitiveness of the GUI. 11/10 for visual and user design.
