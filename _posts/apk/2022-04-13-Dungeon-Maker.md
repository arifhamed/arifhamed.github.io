> _"Prepare for battle - a mob of heroes is about to invade your territory! Build traps facilities in your dungeon, hire monsters, discover relics with mysterious power, and protect your dungeon from heroes that came to take you down." - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dungeon-maker-dark-lord/id1359652100" target="_blank">App Store</a>_

Disclaimer: the iOS link that i have may not be the same game, but it did shared the same icon.

Seems like, just a tower defense game. Build your own dungeon or whatever. it's basically arknights but paid.
