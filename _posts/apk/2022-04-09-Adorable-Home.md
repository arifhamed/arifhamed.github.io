> _"You and your partner have just moved to a new home in the suburbs with your furry companion, an adorable cat named Snow. What to do first? Let's clean up so you can start decorating!" - <a href="https://hyperbeard.com/game/adorable-home/" target="_blank">Hyperbeard Official Site</a>_

There's a couch, a table and a TV stand but not much else. What's missing here?! Oh... silly me, a TV of course. Let's buy that first!

But we can't just watch TV all day. Your partner needs to work and you have important chores around the house to do. Be sure to prepare meals for your partner and feed your kitty (or multiple, kitties as the case may be) to earn love.

Use that love to buy more furniture, decorations, and yes... more CATS for your house to make it utterly adorable! The more cats you have, the more adorable moments you'll get. Capture them in snapshots with your retro camera and collect them all in your photo album.

Really enjoying the game?!? Gather enough love and unlock new areas like the Garden where you can gather love from woodland creatures that come to visit your adorable home.

Adorable Home is a passive and relaxing experience. Come back and check in on the game every couple hours to see something new, gather some love, and continue furnishing your home.

We hope you enjoy!

Adorable Home is LGBTQ+ friendly. It references mature themes and on occasion, depicts characters in revealing outfits; this is a game about partners inside their home (Bedroom, Bathroom, etc.) after all. It may be inappropriate for children.
