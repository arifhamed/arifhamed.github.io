selfishness

today i sat down in the office after picking up a quick bite, and i realised something about my life now, something that all links together. the more i thought about it, it made more sense. it was the reason why i feel like my own sanity was at its seams.

i was full of selfishness/self-centredness/self

in all during the recent weeks in this season, i enthroned myself, nothing else. i realised that i was putting in value in other things so that it would value me.

these are all that i realised are in sync with this selfishness
- reluctant mindset towards bringing my mother to church
- feeling like my time & energy are depleted when it comes to certain responsibilities
- overspending (trivial, but relevant)
- my "worry" over someone else whom i know closely

it is that last one where i decided to take a step back and look at myself, because i did not want to affect them in any way, for i truly care for them, very, very much.

as i took a step back, i saw myself more. this time, i didn't compartmentalize myself and thought it was just one problem in one area. when a house floods, all the rooms are filled.

i realised that, maybe, i have let go of God's love. i realised that, maybe, i was just hollow. i realised that, mayb- no, i was deprived of God's love. it has been quite a while since i was actively wanting for God and his love & encounters. 

i was just empty, and i don't want to be anymore.

perhaps later tonight, i want to experience Him for myself once again. 

```
help me to love with open arms like You do.
a love that erases all the lines and sees the truth.
oh that when they look in my eyes, they would see You.
even in just a smile, they would feel the Father's love.
```
